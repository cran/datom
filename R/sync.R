#' Sync Data-Side Metadata to Storage
#'
#' Mirrors the data repo's metadata to the data store so readers see current
#' state: the manifest (`.metadata/manifest.json`) and each artifact's metadata
#' (`{name}/.metadata/metadata.json`, `version_history.json`). **Every artifact
#' of either kind**, not tables only -- discovery is `.datom_clone_artifact_names()`
#' and has been kind-agnostic since sets existed.
#'
#' **It is not metadata-only, and the name understates it.** For a **set**, a
#' payload missing from storage is restored from the clone -- see
#' `.datom_restore_set_payload()` in this file for the three conditions on that.
#' So this function can put content into storage, not just documents about
#' content.
#'
#' Data-only: governance files (dispatch.json, ref.json, migration_history.json)
#' are not touched here. Governance sync is owned by the governance layer
#' (`gov_sync_dispatch()`).
#'
#' **Two public routes reach this**, and both get the restore: `datom_write(conn)`
#' with no `data` and no `name` (the mirror-everything route), and
#' `datom_validate(fix = TRUE)`. Describing the restore as repair-only would
#' leave a reader surprised to see it fire under a write verb.
#'
#' Used after a failed upload, or by `datom_validate(fix = TRUE)`, to bring
#' storage back in line with the local data clone. Requires a developer
#' connection with a local repo path.
#'

#'   before proceeding. Set to `FALSE` for non-interactive use.

#' Refuse the File-Import Path on a Product Repo
#'
#' A `mode: product` repo **builds** its artifacts: derived tables written from
#' data frames, and one set collecting them. It never onboards source files, so
#' the two import verbs refuse instead of answering. Before this they answered
#' unhelpfully -- `input_files/` exists and is empty on such a repo, so the scan
#' reported "no files found" and handed back a zero-row frame, which describes a
#' repo with nothing to import rather than a repo that does not import.
#'
#' **Read from the file, not from the connection**, and the rule behind that is
#' worth carrying: a check that **authorises a write** must see the config as it
#' is *now*, because a hand edit or a pull can replace it after the connection was
#' built. Only [datom_status()], which reports rather than decides, reads the mode
#' off the connection. A future site applies the same test: does it authorise a
#' write? Then it reads the file.
#'
#' **Three steps in one place, and the middle one is easy to leave out.** Parsing
#' this file makes this a new *gated* parse: every site that reads
#' `.datom/project.yaml` checks its declared format first, or a build that cannot
#' interpret the file acts on fields it has misread. Skipping that step here would
#' reopen exactly that hole, on a path that writes.
#'
#' **Called from both sync verbs, not only the first.** [datom_sync()] takes a
#' manifest data frame, so a caller can hand it rows that a refusing
#' [datom_sync_manifest()] would never have produced.
#'
#' **Above the input-file scan, never in its empty branch.** A product repo with a
#' file dropped into `input_files/` by accident would otherwise be imported, which
#' is the thing this exists to prevent; the unhelpful no-op only happened when the
#' directory was empty.

#' Preview What a Sync Will Change
#'
#' Looks at the files in the project's `input_files/` folder and returns one
#' row per file, saying whether it is new, changed, unchanged since it was last
#' synced, or in a format datom cannot read. Nothing is written. Review the
#' result, drop any rows you do not want, then pass it to [datom_sync()].
#'
#' A file counts as changed when its bytes differ from the file last synced
#' under that name.
#'
#' Files whose format is outside datom's ingestion allowlist (flat tabular
#' formats only) are flagged `"unsupported_format"` up front, without blocking
#' their allowlisted siblings.
#'
#' On a product repo (`mode: product`) it maps the repo's set against source
#' projects instead -- see "On a product repo" below.
#'
#' @param conn A `datom_conn` object from [datom_get_conn()].
#' @param path Optional path to input files directory. Defaults to
#'   `input_files/` inside the repo. Not accepted on a product repo, which reads
#'   no files.
#' @param pattern Glob pattern for file matching. Default `"*"`. On a product
#'   repo it filters source artifact names instead.
#' @param sources On a product repo only, and required there: one `datom_conn`,
#'   or a list of them, for the projects the set's inputs come from. Each
#'   connection's project name is what members are matched on. Refused on an
#'   ordinary repo.
#'
#' @section On a product repo:
#' A product repo owns one set (named in `.datom/project.yaml`), and this call
#' compares that set, as stored, with what each source project holds now. It
#' reads one manifest per source and the stored set; it writes nothing.
#'
#' Tables and sets are treated alike: a set a source holds gets a row, and a
#' member that is a set is compared exactly as a table member is, so a set built
#' from other sets syncs the same way.
#'
#' One row per artifact in the sources whose name matches `pattern`:
#' * `new` -- no member points at it (every row, when the set has no version
#'   yet);
#' * `changed` / `unchanged` -- one member points at it, at an older / the
#'   current version;
#' * `ambiguous` -- two or more members point at it (a live table beside a
#'   frozen baseline, say), so neither will move. Move one with
#'   [datom_update_members()], narrowing by `member` and `tags`.
#'
#' Plus one row for each member the call did not compare:
#' * `excluded` -- its artifact is in a source but does not match `pattern`;
#' * `not_checked` -- its project was not passed in `sources`.
#'
#' The preview never proposes removing a member. A member whose artifact is no
#' longer listed in its source is named in the messages and left pinned. Members
#' in the repo's own project are outputs and get no row: re-derive them, then
#' move them with [datom_update_members()].
#'
#' It stops when `sources` includes the repo's own project, and when a source
#' connection's project name differs from the name that project's own manifest

#' Bring New and Changed Files Into a Project
#'
#' Takes the preview from [datom_sync_manifest()] and saves each new or changed
#' file as a version of a table named after the file; unchanged files are
#' skipped. This is the usual way to bring files into datom. To save a data
#' frame you built in R, use [datom_write()].
#'
#' Reading files needs the rio package (`install.packages("rio")`).
#'
#' Rows flagged `"unsupported_format"` by [datom_sync_manifest()] are reported
#' as `result = "error"` with the recourse in the `error` column; the rest of
#' the batch still processes.
#'
#' On a product repo (`mode: product`) it applies a preview of the repo's set
#' instead -- see "On a product repo" below.
#'
#' @param conn A `datom_conn` object from [datom_get_conn()].
#' @param manifest Data frame from [datom_sync_manifest()]. On an ordinary repo,
#'   with columns `name`, `file`, `format`, `original_file_sha`, `status`. On a
#'   product repo, the set preview: `project`, `name`, `kind`, `version_from`,
#'   `version_to`, `status`. Any subset of its rows will do.
#' @param continue_on_error If `TRUE` (default), continues processing
#'   remaining tables when one fails. If `FALSE`, stops on first error. Not
#'   accepted on a product repo, where one failure stops the call and nothing
#'   has been written.
#' @param sources On a product repo only, and required there: one `datom_conn`,
#'   or a list of them, for the projects named by the rows being applied -- the
#'   same connections the preview was built with. Refused on an ordinary repo.
#' @param tags On a product repo only: the labels given to members added by
#'   `new` rows. Default `list(type = "input")`. A repointed member keeps its
#'   own labels. Refused on an ordinary repo.
#' @param x On a product repo only: the `datom_set` to apply the preview to,
#'   from [datom_get_set()] or [datom_assemble_set()]. Omitted, the repo's
#'   stored set is read, or an empty one used when it has never been written.
#'   Refused on an ordinary repo.
#'
#' @section On a product repo:
#' A product repo owns one set, and this call applies a preview from
#' [datom_sync_manifest()] to it: each `new` row adds a member at `version_to`,
#' labelled with `tags`, and each `changed` row repoints the member it names
#' from `version_from` to `version_to`, keeping that member's labels exactly.
#' Rows of any other status do nothing. Filter the preview first to apply only
#' part of it -- `subset(m, name != "lb")` -- or build the frame by hand with the
#' same columns.
#'
#' **Nothing is written.** The set comes back edited, and it is stored only when
#' you pass it to [datom_write_set()]; the call ends by saying so. The write's
#' default commit message then names what was added and repointed.
#'
#' This is the one difference from syncing files, where each table is written
#' as it syncs. A set is saved in one step, so the edit becomes one version, and
#' you can look at the set, or add to it, before it does.
#'
#' Every member added is read from its source first, which confirms the version
#' exists and records the project that wrote it. The call stops, before
#' changing anything, when:
#' * the set has moved since the preview was built -- a `changed` row's member
#'   is no longer at `version_from`, or a `new` row's artifact is already in the
#'   set. Build the preview again from the current set;
#' * a row's `kind` or `project` disagrees with the artifact it names;
#' * a `new` or `changed` row names a project with no connection in `sources`,
#'   or the same artifact appears in two such rows;
#' * `sources` includes the repo's own project, whose members are outputs.
#'
#' @return On an ordinary repo, the manifest data frame augmented with `result`
#'   and `error` columns. `result` is `"success"`, `"skipped"`, or `"error"`.
#'
#'   On a product repo, the updated `datom_set`, with what changed appended to
#'   its `datom_edits` attribute. Its `version` and `data_sha` are emptied when
#'   any row was applied.

#' independent of the manifest, so it still answers correctly when the manifest
#' is the document under suspicion.
#'
#' Two callers, and they must agree. The data-side metadata sync mirrors exactly
#' these artifacts to storage, and the write-entry check inspects exactly the
#' documents that route is about to write -- so discovering them twice, in two
#' spellings, is how the door ends up checking a different set than the one that
#' gets written.
#'
#' The directory filter is the pre-existing one: dotfiles out, plus the fixed
#' list of non-artifact directories a joint repo carries (`R/`, `tests/`,
#' `renv/`, and so on). It is a convenience rather than the discriminator --
#' `metadata.json` is what actually decides -- which is why a foreign directory
#' not on the list is tolerated rather than misread (R14.2).

#' [datom_summary()] and [datom_status()] count for themselves -- and a
#' predicate written out at each of them is a predicate that can differ at one
#' of them.
#'
#' **An entry that is not a named list is skipped rather than dereferenced.**
#' The upgrade step deliberately passes such an entry through untouched, because

#' reaches `entry$kind` and aborts with "$ operator is invalid for atomic

#' sits outside the error handling that gives it that tolerance. A hand-edited
#' manifest is exactly the document most likely to reach it.
#'
#' Skipping is not the same as tolerating a **missing** `kind`, which stays
#' deliberately uncounted: a typed entry with no type means the conversion was
#' skipped, and a visibly wrong count is the intended signal for that.

#' Say That a Manifest's Format Was Moved Forward

#' which mirrors the converted document to storage. Reads convert too and stay
#' silent, deliberately -- a read changes nothing, and a line on every
#' [datom_list()] call would be noise nobody can act on.
#'
#' Why say anything: conversion is one-way for everybody else. Once this repo's
#' manifest declares the newer format, a collaborator on an older datom no longer
#' finds the artifact list where their build looks for it, and their
#' `datom_list()` reports an empty repo **without erroring**. Their
#' [datom_read()] keeps working, because the data path never touches the
#' manifest. That is a real consequence of a command whose stated job was
#' something else -- `datom_validate(fix = TRUE)` in particular reads as a
#' repair -- and an unannounced one is the silent degradation the whole schema
#' contract exists to remove.

#' Empty Manifest Skeleton
#'
#' The one shape of an empty manifest. Callers that need a manifest when none
#' exists yet build it here rather than inline, so a later change to the
#' manifest's shape has a single place to land.
#'
#' `artifacts` is a **named** empty list on purpose: `jsonlite` serializes an
#' empty bare list as a JSON array (`[]`) and an empty named list as an object
#' (`{}`), and a manifest's artifact block must be an object. Inert today, since
#' nothing writes a manifest that still has zero entries, and correct for the one
#' case where it would.
#'
#' The skeleton declares `schema_version` itself, so no repo ever exists in a
#' state that declares no format at all -- not even between being created and
#' receiving its first artifact. This covers only the built-from-nothing path:
#' a document read from disk in an older shape gets its version from
#' [.datom_manifest_upgrade()] instead, because the skeleton is unreachable
#' whenever a manifest file exists.
#'
#' @param project_name Project name, or `NULL` to omit the field (callers that
#'   only need somewhere to look up entries have no project name to hand).
#' @return A list with `schema_version`, `project_name` (when supplied),
#'   `artifacts` and `summary`.
#' @keywords internal
.datom_manifest_skeleton <- function(project_name = NULL) {
  skeleton <- list(schema_version = .datom_supported_schema)

#' Read a Manifest and Check Its Schema Version
#'
#' The single manifest read. Every reader that takes a manifest *into* datom
#' goes through this, so the compatibility check happens once and cannot be
#' softened by a caller's error handling.
#'
#' Two kinds of failure, handled deliberately differently:
#'
#' * **An IO failure is returned as data** (`ok = FALSE`), because each caller
#'   has its own policy: `datom_list()` and `datom_summary()` abort,
#'   `datom_status()` reports the manifest unavailable and carries on, and the
#'   clone readers fall back to an empty manifest when the file does not exist
#'   yet.
#' * **A schema refusal is thrown**, so the "upgrade datom" message reaches the
#'   user intact. Placed inside a caller's `tryCatch` it would be reworded as
#'   "could not read manifest" at two sites and downgraded to a warning at a
#'   third. Throwing from in here means there is no handler for a caller to put
#'   it inside.
#'
#' **And one document that is not a failure at all.** When the artifact list is
#' missing from where this build looks for it -- either because the format is
#' newer than this build knows, or because the key is simply not there after the
#' conversion has run -- the index is **reconstructed from storage** and a warning
#' says so. The manifest summarises documents that each hold the same facts, so it
#' is the one datom-owned file with something to rebuild it from. A **writer**
#' meeting either condition is refused instead
#' ([.datom_check_write_entry()]): reads limp, writes stop.
#'
#' @param conn A `datom_conn` object.
#' @param scope `"storage"` for the copy in data storage
#'   (`.metadata/manifest.json`), `"clone"` for the git-tracked copy
#'   (`.datom/manifest.json`). Both exist; they can differ, and which one a
#'   caller wants is a real choice rather than a default.
#' @param operation What the caller is about to do with the document --
#'   `"read"` (default) or `"write"`. Passed through to
#'   [.datom_check_schema_version()], where it only selects a word in the
#'   refusal message, so that a write stopped at the door does not report the
#'   format as one this build "cannot read".
#' @return A list with:
#'   * `ok` -- `TRUE` when the manifest was read and parsed.
#'   * `absent` -- `TRUE` only when the document is *known* not to exist. That
#'     is decided for `scope = "clone"`, where testing a local path is free.
#'     For `scope = "storage"` it is always `FALSE`, meaning "not known to be
#'     absent": separating a missing object from an unreachable store would
#'     cost an extra request on every read and no caller distinguishes them.
#'   * `manifest` -- the parsed document **in current shape**, or `NULL` when
#'     `ok` is `FALSE`. A document written in an older shape is converted in
#'     memory on the way through ([.datom_manifest_upgrade()]); one whose artifact
#'     list this build cannot reach is reconstructed from storage
#'     ([.datom_rebuild_manifest()]). Neither modifies the file on disk or in
#'     storage. So no caller ever sees a pre-current shape and none needs a
#'     fallback for one.
#'   * `error` -- the condition that stopped the read, or `NULL`. The whole
#'     condition rather than its text, so a caller can re-signal the original
#'     failure unchanged instead of manufacturing a look-alike.
#'   * `declared` -- the version the document declared **before** conversion, or
#'     `NA_integer_` when nothing was read. Held so a caller that goes on to
#'     write the converted document can say the format moved, without
#'     re-deriving the comparison or reading the file twice.
