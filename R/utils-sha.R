#' Encode a Numeric Payload for Canonical Hashing
#'
#' The single shared numeric encoder used by the `num`, `date`, `time`, and
#' `drtn` column kinds of `datom-cv1`. Produces a fixed, platform-independent
#' byte sequence: IEEE-754 doubles written little-endian regardless of host
#' endianness, with three canonicalizations so that logically-equal values
#' encode identically:
#'
#' * Every `NaN` payload (e.g. `0/0`, a signalling NaN, a negative NaN) is
#'   folded to the pinned canonical quiet `NaN` bit pattern
#'   `0x7ff8000000000000` (see `.datom_nan_canonical`).
#' * `-0.0` is converted to `+0.0`.
#' * `NA_real_` is preserved as its own distinct bit pattern -- it is a
#'   specific `NaN` payload in R (high word `0x7ff00000`, low word `1954`),
#'   fixed by R itself and therefore portable, and is deliberately *not*
#'   folded into the canonical `NaN`, so `NA_real_` and `NaN` encode
#'   differently.
#'
#' No rounding is applied: doubles are encoded bit-exact.
#'
#' **Why the canonical `NaN` is written as bytes, not assigned as a value.**
#' Assigning R's `NaN` (`d[nan_idx] <- NaN`) folds NaN *payloads* but inherits
#' the host's NaN *sign bit*: R's `NaN` is `0x7ff8...` on macOS/arm64 and
#' `0xfff8...` on Linux/x86_64, because it comes from a C-level `0.0/0.0`.
#' That made `data_sha` platform-dependent for any table containing a `NaN` --
#' caught by the CI golden matrix (the macOS job passed, the Linux job did
#' not). Splicing the pinned bytes in directly removes the host from the
#' equation, which is the whole premise of a canonical hash.
#'
#' @param x A vector coercible to double (logical, integer, double, or the
#'   numeric payload of a Date/POSIXct/difftime column).
#' @return A raw vector of `8 * length(x)` bytes.

  # function's documentation.

#' `0x00` otherwise) followed by each value re-encoded to UTF-8 via
#' `enc2utf8()` and NUL-terminated. The leading mask makes `NA` and the
#' empty string `""` distinguishable (both have an empty value section, but
#' `NA` sets its mask byte). No Unicode normalization is applied, so NFC and
#' NFD forms of the same text encode differently (a documented, benign
#' limitation).

#' Compute the datom-cv1 Canonical Content Hash
#'
#' The I/O-free identity engine for `datom-cv1`. Computes `data_sha` from the
#' in-memory logical values only -- no parquet write, no CSV, no temp files,
#' no `as.data.frame()` or coercion, and never invokes arrow. Columns are read
#' via `data[[i]]` / `names(data)` and dimensions via `nrow()` / `ncol()`, so
#' two frames with equal values hash identically regardless of container class
#' (tibble vs data.frame vs grouped_df), row names, or arrow version.
#'
#' Before encoding, every column is scanned through [.datom_hash_recourse()];
#' if any are unsupported the function aborts **once**, listing every offender
#' with its class and canonical recourse. This fires during `data_sha`
#' computation (step 1 of [datom_write()]), before any git or storage
#' mutation, so a refusal leaves no partial state.

# --- Metadata identity: which fields define a version -------------------------

# The fields hashed into `metadata_sha`. Selection is by ALLOWLIST: a field named
# here is identity, and any other key in the document is ignored. Seeded with
# exactly the fields the previous exclusion-based selection hashed, so every
# version identity ever recorded is byte-identical under it.
#
# WHY AN ALLOWLIST. Hashing everything-except-a-list cannot be
# forward-compatible: a build that has never heard of a field cannot know it was
# meant to ignore it, so it folds the field into the hash, disagrees with the
# recorded version, and reports a change on content that did not move -- on every
# run, not once. Adding any bookkeeping field to a metadata document would
# therefore cost every older build a spurious version forever. Two things this
# buys, stated precisely because a looser claim was made when it was first
# proposed: readers compute correct identities, and a repo does not accumulate
# spurious versions. It does NOT keep older writers working -- a writer
# recomputes identity, so a content-bearing addition still disagrees with it, and
# that is refused on separate grounds.
#
# THE FAILURE DIRECTION TO WATCH. An allowlist fails the OPPOSITE way from an
# exclusion list, and it is the more dangerous way if untested: a new field left
# unclassified is silently EXCLUDED, so identity quietly stops responding to real
# content. Whenever a metadata builder gains a field, classify it -- here if it is
# content, in `.datom_metadata_excluded_fields` if it is not. The classification
# test in `test-utils-sha.R` derives the field inventory from the builders
# themselves, so it fails until you do.
#
# Conditionally present fields are marked below. Absence is spelled by omitting
# the key (never by a NULL or an empty value), so an absent field simply
# contributes nothing to the hash. The vector itself is in byte order for
# readability; ordering is immaterial, since the fields are sorted before hashing.
#
#   data_sha          always       the content identity itself
#   hash_algo         always       a new algorithm is a new identity regime
#   kind              always       table or set. In identity so that a table and a
#                                  set can never share a version: without it, two
#                                  artifacts of different kinds whose remaining
#                                  hashed fields agreed would mint the same
#                                  version. The cost was known and accepted when
#                                  the field was introduced -- a rebuilt table
#                                  document hashes differently from the recorded
#                                  one, so the next write of every existing table
#                                  mints one extra version on unchanged content.
#                                  Bounded and in the safe direction: same

#                                artifact rests on the repo's own declaration
#                                rather than on a label somebody typed into a
#                                reader connection. NOT identity, and the reason
#                                is not cost: identical bytes written into two
#                                projects SHOULD share a version, which is what
#                                content addressing is for, and a fetch through
#                                the wrong connection that returned identical
#                                bytes returned the right bytes. What was wrong
#                                in that case was the citation, not the identity.
#                                So no existing artifact mints a version when this
#                                field arrives -- unlike `kind`, which did, and
#                                which this looks exactly like from the shape of
#                                the edit alone.

#' (integer vs double, character vector vs list) introduced by JSON

#' The canonical-form half of `metadata_sha`, split from field selection so that

#' fields becomes bytes and knows nothing about which fields are identity.
#'
#' Sorts field names by C-locale byte order (`method = "radix"`) before hashing
#' so the result is deterministic regardless of field insertion order **and**
#' regardless of the host's `LC_COLLATE` (default collation sorts differ between
#' `C` and e.g. `en_US.UTF-8`, which would otherwise make the same metadata hash
#' differently on different machines). Sorting here rather than relying on the
#' declared order of `.datom_metadata_identity_fields` is deliberate: it means
#' hash stability does not depend on how that constant happens to be written, so
