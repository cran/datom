# Sets: the second artifact kind, written and read.
#
# A set is a reference layer, not a data layer. Its payload is a JSON document of
# pointers at existing artifact versions plus text labels, and everything else --
# version history, content addressing, change detection, the git-gates-storage
# ordering -- is the same machinery a table write uses.
#
# THE WRITE CANONICALIZES; THE READ NEVER DOES. Every "same fact, two spellings"
# decision is made once, on the way in. The read parses, normalizes
# REPRESENTATION only (the three R shapes a JSON string array comes back as), and
# reshapes nothing -- see `.datom_read_set_payload()` for what that costs if it is
# undone.
#
# FIVE THINGS ON THE WRITE SIDE ARE LOAD-BEARING AND EASY TO UNDO BY TIDYING.
#
#   1. TIDY, THEN VALIDATE. Tidying clears the spellings nobody can reasonably
#      care about (tag values out of order, a duplicated label, a one-element
#      array, a key pointing at nothing), so validation only ever reports genuine
#      ambiguity. Validating first would make every tidy rule unreachable. And
#      writing without tidying would let one fact mint two different `data_sha`
#      values, since a present key with an empty value hashes differently from an
#      absent one.
#
#   2. THE FILE'S MEMBER ORDER IS NOT THE HASH'S MEMBER ORDER, and the difference
#      is deliberate. The hash sorts member digests, which keeps the encoder
#      ignorant of what an `id` looks like. The file sorts by
#      `project` || `name` || `version`, which is stable under an edit -- with
#      digest order, editing one member's tag would RELOCATE its entry and
#      `git diff` would report a delete plus an insert instead of one changed
#      field, undoing the whole reason the git copy sits at a stable path.
#
#   3. TWO PATHS, ONE PAYLOAD, DIFFERENT ADDRESSES. Git holds `{name}/set.json`
#      at a stable path and is modified in place, so git owns the history and
#      diffs are member-level. Storage holds the same bytes content-addressed at
#      `{name}/{data_sha}.json`, so a reader with no clone can fetch an exact
#      version. Do NOT content-address the git side: every version would be a new
#      file and history would have to be read by listing filenames, which is
#      hand-maintaining what git already maintains.
#
#   4. NEVER RE-EMIT A PAYLOAD FOR A `data_sha` ALREADY IN HISTORY. Reuse the
#      stored object and carry its recorded `document_sha` forward. Recomputing
#      the hash from freshly emitted bytes while reusing the stored object records
#      a hash of bytes nobody stored, and every per-chunk test passes -- it
#      surfaces later as a refused read of a valid version. See
#      `.datom_resolve_document_sha()`.
#
#   5. `document_sha` IS POPULATED BEFORE THE METADATA DOCUMENT IS WRITTEN.
#      `jsonlite` does not omit a NULL element, it writes `{}`, so a document
#      written while the field is still unpopulated has every expected key and one
#      of them is an empty object. A names-only field-set check cannot see that,
#      which is why the tests assert on the written bytes.
#
# There is deliberately NO cycle detection, no visited-set guard, and no depth
# limit. A member pins an immutable version and declaring one requires that
# version to already exist, so a set cannot reference anything that contains it.
# The self-reference refusal below is a nonsense check, not cycle detection.


# --- the two gates -------------------------------------------------------------

#' Refuse a Set Write the Repo Has Not Declared
#'
#' Checks that read the clone's `.datom/project.yaml` directly, all of them before
#' anything is hashed or written:
#'
#' 1. The config's declared format must be one this build can read
#'    ([.datom_check_project_schema()]). It runs first because the two checks
#'    below read fields *out of* this file: a future format that renamed or moved
#'    `set:` would make check 3 report "this repo declares `mode: product` but
#'    names no set" and send the user to hand-edit a file that is already correct.
#'    An actionable-looking message that is wrong is worse than no answer. The
#'    connection-time gate does not make this one redundant -- the file can be
#'    hand-edited or pulled between opening a connection and writing through it,
#'    which is the same reason the forward-compatibility door is re-run after a
#'    route's own pull.
#' 2. The repo must declare `mode: product`. A set written into a repo that does
#'    not is a set with no declared owner, which defeats the one below it too.
#' 3. The set's name must be the one the repo declares under `set:`. This is what
#'    makes "one repo = one set = one product" true rather than aspirational, and
#'    it is the precondition the self-reference refusal depends on -- that refusal
#'    needs the set's own identity, and this is where it is established.
#'
#' **Read from `project.yaml`, not from the connection.** Only
#' `min_writer_version` rides on a `datom_conn`; `mode` and `set` are read here,
#' at the one place that needs them, so nothing has to be threaded through
#' connection construction for two fields with one consumer. If a later caller
#' wants them on the conn it is a move with one call site to update, rather than a
#' decision to reopen.
#'
#' **`datom_init_repo(mode = "product", set = <name>)` is what declares both
#' fields**, so the supported route into this check is a repo created that way. It
#' shipped inert one release earlier, on purpose: a build that can *notice* the
#' declaration has to exist before anything writes it, or the declaration reaches
#' installs that walk straight past it. Hand-editing the file still works and some
#' fixtures do it, which is also what a repo created before that argument existed
#' needs.

#' @param name The set name the caller supplied, or `NULL` to take the repo's
#'   declared one.

#' Check the Caller's Extra Paths Before a Set Write Does Anything
#'
#' `include_paths` is the **only** way a commit datom makes on its own initiative
#' may carry a path datom does not own, and it is allowed only because the caller
#' enumerated it (R14.3). What it buys is that checking out a set version's commit
#' yields the data pointers **and** the code and environment that produced them.
#' So every refusal here is a refusal to produce a commit that would claim more
#' than it holds.
#'
#' Four refusals, in this order, each with its own condition class:
#'
#' 1. **Not a path inside the clone.** An absolute path, or one climbing out
#'    through `..`, refused lexically before the filesystem is touched.
#'    `fs::path()` joins an absolute second argument *onto* the clone path rather
#'    than replacing it, so `/etc/passwd` would otherwise be reported as a missing
#'    path inside the repo -- a correct refusal whose message names the wrong
#'    thing.
#' 2. **A datom-owned path.** `.datom/`, the set being written, and any artifact
#'    directory already in the clone. The write stages those itself, so listing one
#'    is either a misunderstanding or an attempt to hand-place a datom document
#'    into a commit through a caller's argument.
#' 3. **A path that does not exist.** An error, never a skip: a joint commit is
#'    deterministic or it is refused.
#' 4. **A path git is ignoring.** `git2r::add()` on a gitignored path raises
#'    nothing and stages nothing, and [.datom_git_commit()] cannot notice, because
#'    it objects only when the staging area ends up empty and datom's own files are
#'    always in it. The commit would therefore succeed while omitting exactly the
#'    file the caller named, and the set version would claim a joint commit it does
#'    not have. Refused rather than dropped in silence (decided 2026-09-18).
#'
#' **This runs before the first hash and the first local write**, the same
#' placement as the two gates above, so a refused joint commit leaves nothing
#' behind. One consequence, stated so nobody later softens it: change detection
#' needs the hashes, so a bad path is an error **even when the set is unchanged**.
#' The refusal wins over the no-op.
#'
#' @param conn A `datom_conn` object with a local path.
#' @param name The set being written, as resolved by
#'   [.datom_check_set_write_gates()]. Named rather than discovered because a
#'   first write has no directory to discover.
#' @param include_paths The caller's character vector, or `NULL`.
#' @return Absolute paths in the clone, or `NULL`. **Absolute**, because
#'   [.datom_commit_and_mirror()] relativises what it is given against `conn$path`,
#'   and `fs::path_rel()` on an already-relative path resolves it against the
#'   working directory instead -- which aborts with "files do not exist" pointing

#' Drops exact duplicates -- same `id` **and** same `tags` -- by `datom-sv1`
#' member digest, then sorts by `project`, `name`, `version`.
#'
#' **Two sort keys exist and each has its own reason.** The identity hash orders
#' member digests, which is what keeps the encoder from having to know what an
#' `id` looks like. The file orders by name, which is what keeps an entry in place
#' when its tags change so that `git diff` shows one changed field. `version` is
#' in the key because two versions of one name are legal members, and would
#' otherwise have no defined relative order.
#'
#' **No tiebreaker is required, and none may be added.** The only way two members
#' can share `project` || `name` || `version` is the same `id` with *different*
#' `tags`, which survives dedup because the digest covers tags -- and that payload
#' is refused one step later. R's radix sort is stable, so the tie resolves to
#' caller order in the meantime. A defensive tiebreaker would be dead code.
#'
#' Runs **after** validation, unlike the rest of canonicalization, because the

#' cannot encode. Reaching it first would report a bad tag value in the encoder's

#' Refuse a Payload Only a Whole-Payload View Can Judge
#'
#' Three refusals that `.datom_validate_members()` deliberately cannot make,

#'
#' * **Zero members.** An empty citable product has no content to identify, and
#'   the recourse is simply to write the set once its first output exists.
#' * **The same `id` listed twice with different `tags`.** Deduplication does not
#'   catch this -- the digest covers tags, so both entries survive -- and the
#'   payload then holds one member twice with conflicting labels, which a consumer
#'   projecting tags into a folder view sees as one artifact in two places.
#'   Refused rather than tidied because both ways to tidy it guess: merging the
#'   tags is right if the caller meant both categories and nonsense if two code
#'   paths disagreed, and picking one entry is arbitrary.
#' * **Self-reference.** A set listing itself, at any version, is refused.
#'
#' **The same `project` and `name` at two different `version`s is legal and must
#' stay legal**: a product carrying a current table beside a locked baseline is
#' atypical and entirely sensible. So the duplicate check keys on the **full**
#' `id`, never on `project` + `name` -- which is the tightening that looks natural
#' and would break that use silently.
#'

#' Refuse a Set Whose Outputs Were Built From Versions It Does Not Pin
#'
#' A table records the parent versions it was derived from. When a set lists
#' that table **and** one of its parents, the two claims can disagree: the set
#' says "input `lb` is version A" while the output says "I was built from `lb`
#' version B". A citation of that set would then describe a product that was
#' never built. This check stops the write and names both versions.
#'
#' **What is checked.** Every member in the set's own project -- all tables,
#' since a product repo holds one set and a set listing itself is refused first.
#' For each parent its snapshot records, the members naming that parent's
#' project and table are found. None -> not checked (the parent is not part of
#' the product). Some, and one of them at the parent's version -> fine, which is
#' what keeps a live table beside a frozen baseline legal. Some, and none at
#' that version -> a mismatch. All mismatches are collected and reported
#' together.
#'
#' **Members of other projects are not read**: the write holds a connection to
#' its own project only.
#'
#' **An unreadable snapshot stops the write** rather than being skipped. A
#' version that does not exist means the set would point at data nobody can
#' fetch, and storage that cannot be reached would fail the write anyway -- only
#' later, after the local files are written. Metadata only: one small JSON per

# --- the write verb ------------------------------------------------------------

#' Save a Set as a New Version
#'
#' Saves a [set][datom-package]: a named list of exact versions of tables (or
#' other sets), plus labels, that you can cite with one version string. A set
#' holds no data, so saving one copies nothing. Saving the same members and
#' labels again creates no new version.
#'
#' One repo holds one set. The repo declares which, in `.datom/project.yaml`:
#'
#' ```yaml
#' mode: product
#' set: study001-adam
#' ```
#'
#' Both are checked before anything is hashed or written, so a repo that has not
#' declared itself a product repo is refused with nothing left behind.
#'
#' @section What a set carries, and what it does not:
#' User metadata is **tags**, and there is no `metadata =` parameter: a
#' description is a tag, and a second channel for the same thing would be two
#' places to look. There is no view or navigation configuration either -- a
#' folder-like hierarchy is a projection a consumer computes over tags, and any
#' number of them cost nothing precisely because none is stored.
#'
#' A set records **no** `parents` and **no** `source_lineage`. Members are
#' references, not derivation: lineage flows through tables, and the set is how
#' you *found* a table rather than how data reached it.
#'
#' @section Versions, and what moves one:
#' The version covers the **whole payload**, members and tags alike. So editing a
#' tag or a description mints a new version, which is intended: a set exists to be
#' citable, and "same citation, different labels" would be a lie to whoever cited
#' it. What does **not** mint a version is a purely syntactic edit -- reordering
#' tag values or members, repeating a label, or writing a single label as a
#' one-element array. Those are normalised on the way in, so re-writing an
#' identical payload is a no-op.
#'
#' **Your code does not move a version either, even though it travels in the same
#' commit** (see `include_paths` below). Refactor your build script, re-run it,
#' get the same members and tags, and nothing is minted: the write is the usual
#' no-op. [datom_history()] then shows the version it showed before, with a
#' `commit_sha` pointing at the commit that **first** produced that payload -- a
#' commit that does not contain the code you just wrote. That is the recorded
#' value doing its job rather than going stale; see [datom_history()] for why the
#' commit is deliberately not part of the version.
#'
#' @section Where the payload lives:
#' Two copies, at two deliberately different addresses. Git holds
#' `{name}/set.json` at one stable path, modified in place, so git carries the
#' history and `git diff` between two versions shows which members changed.
#' Storage holds the same bytes content-addressed at `{name}/{data_sha}.json`, so
#' a reader with no clone can fetch an exact version. Any past version is still
#' reconstructible from the clone alone with
#' `git show <commit>:{name}/set.json`.
#'
#' @section Carrying your code and environment into the same commit:
#' `include_paths` stages paths you name into the **one** commit that carries the
#' payload and its metadata. So checking out a set version's commit yields the
#' data pointers, the logic that produced them **and** the environment they ran in
#' -- one clone, one checkout, the whole product. The joint version is
#' **structural**: nothing records a link between the set and your files, because
#' the commit *is* the link.
#'
#' ```r
#' datom_write_set(conn, members,
#'                 include_paths = c("R", "dp", "renv.lock"))
#' ```
#'
#' Four refusals, all of them before anything is hashed or written, so a refusal
#' leaves nothing behind: a path that does not exist, a path outside the clone, a
#' path datom owns (`.datom/`, the set, any artifact directory), and a path
#' `.gitignore` excludes. The last one matters because git stages an ignored path
#' silently and without complaint, which would leave the set version claiming a
#' commit that omits exactly the file you named. Refusals win over the no-op
#' below, since they are settled before change detection runs.
#'
#' **An unchanged set is still a no-op, however dirty those paths are.** No
#' commit, no version, and a message pointing at [datom_repo_commit()], which is
#' the verb for committing your own content at a moment you chose. A data write
#' that quietly committed work in progress is the thing datom's explicit file
#' lists exist to prevent, and idempotency must not become a side door into it.
#'
#' @section Outputs must be built from the inputs the set pins:
#' A table written with `parents` records which versions it was derived from.
#' When a set lists such a table and also lists one of its parents, the write
#' checks they agree: if the set pins the parent at a different version from
#' the one the table was built from, and not at that version too, the write
#' stops and names the member, the parent and both versions. Nothing is
#' written. Re-derive the output with `datom_parent(x = )`, which takes the
#' versions from the set, or move the input with [datom_update_members()].
#'
#' Only tables in the set's own project are checked, and a parent the set does
#' not list is not checked. A set carrying one table at two versions (a live
#' copy beside a frozen baseline) passes as long as one of them is the version
#' used. Each such member's recorded metadata is read from storage; if it
#' cannot be read -- a version that does not exist, or storage that cannot be
#' reached -- the write stops too.
#'
#' @section Editing a set that already exists:
#' Read it, change it, write it back. `members` accepts a `datom_set` from
#' [datom_get_set()] directly, so the loop needs no unpacking:
#'
#' ```r
#' x <- datom_get_set(conn, "study001-adam")
#' x$members <- c(x$members, list(datom_member(conn, "lb", v)))
#' datom_write_set(conn, x)
#' ```
#'
#' The set's own `tags` come along with it unless `tags` is supplied, so a
#' read-append-write cannot silently drop the description. Passing
#' `x$members` instead works too, and there `tags` is yours to carry.
#'
#' A set built in steps with [datom_assemble_set()] and [datom_add_member()] is
#' written the same way, and pipes into the write:
#'
#' ```r
#' x |> datom_write_set(conn = conn)
#' ```
#'
#' @section A set is written into its own repo:
#' A `datom_set` records its name and the project it belongs to. Both are
#' checked before anything is hashed or written: a set named for another repo's
#' declared set, or belonging to another project, stops the write. Writing it
#' anyway would move it into this repo's project without saying so -- the name
#' check alone would miss that, since two product repos may declare the same set
#' name. A `name` argument that disagrees with the set's own name stops it too.
#' A plain list of member records carries neither, so neither is checked.
#'
#' @param conn A `datom_conn` object from [datom_get_conn()], scoped to the
#'   product repo (developer role).
#' @param members A list of member records from [datom_member()], each pinning one
#'   artifact version and optionally carrying its own tags -- or a `datom_set`,
#'   from [datom_get_set()] or [datom_assemble_set()], edited or not.
#'   Hand-assembled lists are refused.
#' @param tags Optional named list of set-level text labels -- facts about the
#'   collection itself, such as a description. Same grammar as a member's tags: a
#'   value is one string or several, text only.
#' @param name The set's name. Defaults to the `set:` field in
#'   `.datom/project.yaml`; when supplied it must equal it.
#' @param message Optional commit message. Omitted, it is `Update {name}` --
#'   except for a set edited with [datom_add_member()], [datom_update_members()]
#'   or [datom_remove_members()], where the default names the members added,
#'   moved or dropped, with their versions. So a set assembled in steps gets
#'   `Update {name}: add N members` on its first write. Pass `x` rather than
#'   `x$members` to get that, since the change list travels with the object.
#' @param include_paths Optional character vector of repo-relative paths -- your
#'   own code, `renv.lock`, build state -- staged into the **same commit** as the
#'   set. Never mirrored to storage: the storage namespace holds datom artifacts

# --- the read path -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE READ NEVER TIDIES, AND THE TIDY FUNCTIONS ARE RIGHT THERE INVITING IT.
# `.datom_tidy_set_payload()` run on a healthy payload changes nothing -- the
# write already canonicalized -- so reaching for it passes every test today and
# diverges later. Three reasons it must not be reached for, in order:
#
#   1. LOAD-BEARING. Repair must neither re-upload payload bytes nor recompute
#      `document_sha` for a version already stored. A repair built on a tidying
#      read does both: it re-emits reshaped bytes over an object whose recorded
#      hash describes different bytes.
#   2. THE READ REPORTS WHAT WAS CITED. A reorder must not mint a version; that
#      does not license a reader to perform one.
#   3. DROPPING AN EMPTY-VALUED KEY removes a key the document actually contains.
#
# The one thing the read does normalize is representation: `jsonlite` unboxes on
# write, so one tag key comes back as a character vector, a length-1 character, or
# a list of length-1 characters, depending on how many labels it had. Those are
# three R spellings of one JSON value, not three values. Never touch the presence
# axis: an absent key stays absent, an absent value stays NULL, and nothing
# becomes `character(0)` or `NA`.


#' Normalize a Parsed JSON String Array to a Character Vector
#'
#' `jsonlite::fromJSON(simplifyVector = FALSE)` returns a JSON array of strings
#' as a list of length-1 characters, and `auto_unbox = TRUE` on the write means a
#' single label was written as a bare string. So one tag key comes back in three
#' shapes -- `character(1)`, a list of 1, or a list of n -- for what is one value
#' in the document.
#'
#' Same strings, same order, same count: this is a representation change, not a
#' content change, which is why order is preserved and duplicates are kept.
#' Sorting or deduplicating here would be the write's canonicalization performed
#' by a reader.
#'
#' Anything that is not an all-text array is returned untouched. A reader has no
#' caller intent to tidy toward and nothing downstream requires tag values to be
#' text, so an odd value is reported by whoever tries to use it rather than
#' refused here.
#'
#' @param v A parsed JSON value.
#' @return A character vector when `v` was an all-text array, otherwise `v`.

#' Normalize One Member Record Read Back from a Payload
#'
#' Normalizes representation in `id` and `tags`, then makes the one refusal the

#' and a caller comparing a list against a string would conclude that a member of

#' Resolve One Member Pointer Without a Connection in the Closure
#'
#' Builds the `$fetch` link every member of a read set carries: call it with a
#' connection to the member's project and it resolves the pointer -- a table
#' member to data via [datom_read()], a set member to references via
#' [datom_get_set()].
#'
#' **`fetch` rather than `read` or `get` because it is genuinely both.** This is
#' the one polymorphic door in the design, and the member level is where the
#' domain forces it: iterating members, the caller cannot know each kind in
#' advance. At the top level they named one artifact they chose, which is why
#' [datom_read()] and [datom_get_set()] stay separate verbs.
#'
#' **This function is namespace-level, and that is load-bearing.** A factory
#' defined inside [datom_get_set()] would put that call's frame -- which holds
#' `conn`, and therefore the PAT -- on the closure's parent chain, and
#' `saveRDS()` of the member would write the token into the file. Measured, same
#' code both ways: nested, 2094 bytes with the token present; namespace-level,
#' 1609 bytes without. Every argument is forced so that nothing is left as a
#' promise pointing back at the caller's frame. The guard is a test on the
#' **serialized bytes**, not on `environment(link)`, because an environment check
#' passes on the broken shape -- there the connection sits one frame further up.
#'
#' The link carries its own pointer as an attribute, so a consumer holding only a
#' projection can still cite what they used. Links built without it cannot be
#' repaired afterwards, which is why it ships with the factory rather than later.
#'
#' **It does not compare the member's project against the connection's, and it
#' must not.** That looks free -- both names are in hand -- and it would refuse
#' working reads. For a **reader** connection, which is the primary consumer of a
#' set, `project_name` is a label the caller passes to [datom_get_conn()]: the
#' namespace comes from the store's bucket and prefix and nothing validates the
#' label against the repo. So a mismatch is the ordinary case rather than the error
#' case, and a gate here would abort a fetch that resolves correctly. **Recording
#' the writer's own project name in metadata does not change this.** It makes the
#' member's side of the comparison trustworthy; the connection's side is still a
#' label nobody checked, so comparing them still refuses working reads. Pinned by a
#' test that fetches through a deliberately mismatched label. A *hint* on an
#' already-failed resolution is a different thing and is left to the task that

#' Say Which Project a Member Belongs To, When Fetching It Has Already Failed
#'
#' The highest-value message in the set design, and it is a **hint on failure,
#' never a gate**. Access in datom is per project and not conjunctive, so
#' resolving a member of another project through this connection genuinely does
#' not work -- but without this bullet it presents as a missing object, which
#' names the wrong problem and sends the reader looking for corruption.
#'
#' **Why it cannot be a check that runs first.** A connection's `project_name` is
#' not a verified fact. On a reader connection -- the primary consumer of a set --
#' it is a label passed to [datom_get_conn()]: the namespace comes from the
#' store's root and prefix and nothing compares the label against the repo. So a
#' mismatch is the ordinary case, and refusing on it aborts fetches that resolve
#' correctly. Verified end to end by a test that fetches through a deliberately
#' wrong label.
#'
#' Recording the writer's own project name in metadata made the **member's** side
#' of that comparison trustworthy; the connection's side is unchanged. Comparing a
#' verified value against an unverified one still refuses working reads, which is
#' why this stayed a hint. What it did buy is the wording: the message names the
#' project the member's own writer recorded, rather than a project someone typed.

#' Download, Verify and Parse a Set's Stored Payload
#'
#' Download, hash, **then** parse. The order is the point: a set read must not
#' parse an unverified payload, which is the same gate position
#' [.datom_read_parquet()] uses for `parquet_sha`.
#'
#' **`.datom_storage_read_json()` cannot be used here, and it would work.** It
#' parses, so after calling it there is nothing left to hash but bytes
#' re-serialized locally -- a hash of bytes nobody stored, which is exactly the
#' defect the write path guards against, inverted. It returns a structure
#' identical to parsing the downloaded file, so nothing fails if you reach for
#' it; the integrity check simply stops meaning anything.
#'
#' **A missing `document_sha` is an error, not a skip.** `parquet_sha`'s
#' skip-on-absent branch exists purely as a grace for metadata written before
#' that field did. Sets have recorded `document_sha` since their first write, so
#' there is no legacy population to be lenient about, and reproducing the grace
#' would build a silent-degradation path on purpose.
#'
#' `data_sha` is deliberately **not** recomputed from the parsed payload. It is

#' Read a datom Set
#'
#' Returns a [set][datom-package]'s members and labels, at its current version
#' or a past one. It reads no table data: to get the data behind a member, use
#' [datom_fetch_member()]. Works with reader connections.
#'
#' Reading a set requires access to the set's own project only. A member is a
#' pointer, and resolving it is a separate, deliberate step -- so a 50-member
#' product is readable by someone entitled to none of its members.
#'
#' @section What comes back:
#' References and labels, and no data at all -- which is why the verb is `get`
#' rather than `read`.
#'
#' A `datom_set`: `name`, `project`, `version`, `data_sha`, `tags` and
#' `members`. The four identifying facts are there so that a caller who passed
#' `version = NULL` can still say which version they got, because a set exists to
#' be cited. `version` is the version **recorded** in the history, so an
#' 8-character prefix goes in and the full version comes back.
#'
#' `members` is a flat, **unnamed** list in payload order. Not name-keyed, and
#' the reason is not style: the same artifact at two different versions is a
#' legal pair of members, two projects may both hold a `dm`, and R's `$`
#' partial-matches on lists -- so a name-keyed list would answer plausibly and
#' wrongly. The unique key is the full `id`.
#'
#' One of the four identifying facts has a limit worth knowing before you cite it:
#'
#' * **`version` can be `NULL`.** It is the version *recorded* in
#'   `version_history.json` for the state `metadata.json` describes, and a
#'   truncated or partly-synced history records no such entry. A manufactured
#'   version would be a wrong statement rather than a missing one, so the field is
#'   left empty and [datom_validate()] owns the inconsistency. A version-pinned
#'   read always reports one, since the entry is what it resolved through.
#'
#' `project` is the name the set's **own metadata** records -- the declaration of
#' the repo that wrote it, not the name on your connection. It falls back to the
#' connection's name only for a set written by a datom that predates the field,
#' which no released build ever was. Each **member** carries its own recorded
#' `id$project` for the same reason, resolved through a slightly longer route
#' because that value is durable and hashed rather than displayed.
#'
#' @section Resolving a member:
#' Each member is `id` (`project`, `name`, `kind`, `version`), its optional
#' `tags`, and `fetch`:
#'
#' ```r
#' x <- datom_get_set(conn, "study001-adam")
#' dm <- x$members[[1]]$fetch(conn)
#' ```
#'
#' `fetch` resolves whatever the pointer points at: a table member yields data, a
#' set member yields another `datom_set`. **A link pins the version it was read
#' at** -- it is a citation, not a subscription, so it never drifts to the latest.
#' Pass a connection scoped to the member's own project; same-project members
#' resolve through the connection you already have.
#'
#' Two reads of the same set are **not** `identical()`, because closures compare
#' by environment. Compare `m[c("id", "tags")]` instead, or use
#' `identical(a, b, ignore.environment = TRUE)`.
#'
#' @section Integrity, and what is not rechecked:
#' The stored payload is verified against the recorded `document_sha` **before it
#' is parsed**, and a version that records no `document_sha` is an error rather
#' than a skipped check. `data_sha` is not recomputed: it is the address the
#' payload was fetched from, so it would catch nothing the byte hash did not, and
#' it would refuse a payload written by a newer datom. Nothing in the payload is
#' re-canonicalized -- what you are shown is what was cited.
#'
#' @param conn A `datom_conn` object from [datom_get_conn()], scoped to the
#'   set's project. A storage-only connection with no git clone is enough.
#' @param name The set's name.
#' @param version Optional version (`metadata_sha`, or a prefix of one). `NULL`
#'   reads the current version.
#'
#' @return A `datom_set`: a list of `name`, `project`, `version` (possibly
#'   `NULL`), `data_sha`, `tags` and `members`.
#' @seealso [datom_write_set()] to write one, [datom_member()] to declare a
#'   member, [datom_read()] for tables.
