#' Validate a Caller-Supplied Relative Storage Key
#'
#' Guards a whole key string that a caller composed, as opposed to one datom
#' built itself from validated parts. The internal key builders in

#' `[a-zA-Z0-9_ ()-]` and `.datom_validate_sha()` only hex, so their output
#' cannot contain a `..` segment or a `datom/` segment. A key arriving through
#' a public export has had no such filtering.
#'
#' Two distinct failures are caught:
#'
#' * **Traversal / shape.** A `..` segment or a leading `/` escapes the datom
#'   namespace on the local backend, where the key is pasted into a path and
#'   resolved by the filesystem (`.datom_local_path()`). This applies to reads
#'   as much as to writes -- reading `../../secrets.json` is exactly the sort
#'   of probe the guard sweep in #74 existed to close.
#' * **A full key passed where a relative one belongs.** The two key shapes are
#'   documented at the top of `R/utils-path.R`; mixing them does not error
#'   today, it resolves under `{prefix}/datom/{prefix}/datom/...` and finds
#'   nothing, which reads to the caller as a missing object rather than a
#'   malformed key. A `datom` path segment is the detectable form, and it can
#'   never occur in a legitimate relative key because `datom` is a reserved
#'   artifact name (`.datom_reserved_names`).

# --- S3 namespace safety -------------------------------------------------------

#' Check Whether a Storage Namespace is Free
#'
#' Checks for the existence of `.metadata/manifest.json` in the target
#' namespace. If found, the namespace is occupied by an existing datom project
#' and this aborts with `datom_namespace_occupied`, naming the occupying project
#' when it can be read.
#'
#' Checks for the object first (cheap) and only reads the manifest when the
#' namespace is occupied, to extract the project name for the error message.
#'
#' **A store this connection cannot reach means *unknown*, and unknown fails
#' closed.** It used to warn and continue, which was not a deferral of the check
#' but a silent removal of it: `datom_init_repo()` went on to push the git repo and
#' then aborted at the manifest upload, and the recovery it pointed at performs no
#' occupancy check of any kind. So the tolerance never produced a working offline
#' init -- storage is required to finish one -- and its only reachable effect was
#' getting past this check, with the outcome being a manifest written over another
#' project's. Refusing here instead names the real problem at the moment it is
#' known, rather than surfacing later as an unrelated upload failure.
#'
#' There is no `.force` advice in that refusal, deliberately: `.force` skips this
#' check but not the manifest upload, so it cannot rescue an init without storage
#' either. Offering it would be advice that does not work.
#'
#' **The tolerated-failure detection lives here, around the one call that touches
#' storage**, rather than in a handler wrapping this whole function -- which is
#' what the caller used to do. That shape had two defects worth not
#' reintroducing: it recognised the occupied refusal by **matching its message
#' text**, so rewording the message would have quietly downgraded a refusal to a
#' warning; and it swallowed anything it could not recognise, so any abort added to
#' this function later would have been downgraded too, with nothing failing to say
#' so.
#'
#' **The condition classes are what callers dispatch on** -- never the message.
#'
#' @param conn A `datom_conn` object (typically a temporary conn built by
#'   `datom_init_repo()` before the repo is fully initialised).
#' @param overridable Whether the caller honours `.force` as a way past an
#'   occupied namespace. `TRUE` (the default) adds that route to the refusal's
#'   recourse; `FALSE` says the override does not apply and why.
#'
#'   **It exists because this function cannot know its caller's policy, which is
#'   the same reason the backend label is an argument's worth of work rather than
#'   a constant.** A product repo is checked with no opt-out, so a static
#'   "pass `.force = TRUE` to override" bullet sent exactly those users into a
#'   flag that changes nothing -- a message routing somebody in a circle, which is
#'   the failure this function's own backend-neutral wording was fixed for one
#'   commit earlier.

# --- Repo schema version contract ---------------------------------------------

# Highest repo schema version this build of datom can read.

.datom_supported_schema <- 2L

# Highest `.datom/project.yaml` format this build can read.
#
# Its OWN number, deliberately, rather than the shared ceiling above. The shared
# ceiling works while every document on it is machine-written by one build in one
# operation; `project.yaml` is written once at init and then hand-edited for
# years, so its shape moves on its own clock. Keeping it separate means this stays
# 1L through every manifest or metadata bump and moves only when the config's own
# shape breaks -- and, more to the point, it means there are no false refusals.
# The config check runs while a developer connection is built, so a build one
# version behind on the shared ceiling would lose the whole developer path,
# including reads that would have worked, on a file whose shape never changed.
#
# The hole this leaves is a FORGOTTEN bump: a shape change shipped with the number
# unmoved is silently misread by an older build. `test-conn.R` closes it with a
# test that fails when the key set `datom_init_repo()` writes changes without this
# constant changing. That test forces a DECISION, not a bump -- an addition is
# reader-safe, so extending the expected key set and leaving this at 1L is often
# the right answer.
.datom_project_schema <- 1L

#' Check a Document's Declared Schema Version
#'
#' Reader-side compatibility check for one metadata or manifest document.
#' Called wherever such a document enters datom from storage or from the local
#' clone, so that a repo written by a *newer* datom fails with an actionable
#' message instead of degrading silently -- an older reader would otherwise
#' find none of the fields it expects and report an empty repo.
#'
#' The check is deliberately asymmetric:
#'
#' * **Newer than this build** -- abort, pointing at the upgrade. Continuing
#'   would mean interpreting a format this build does not know.
#' * **Absent** -- treated as v1 and tolerated, so every repo written before
#'   `schema_version` existed keeps working unchanged.
#' * **Equal or older** -- proceed.
#'
#' A present-but-unusable value (a string, a fraction, `NA`, a vector) aborts
#' as a corrupt document rather than being coerced. Coercion here would compare
#' garbage against the supported version and could silently read as
#' "supported"; and in R a comparison against `NA` propagates into `if()` as an
#' opaque "missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed" error rather than anything a
#' user can act on.
#'
#' Both aborts carry a condition class so every call site is provably the same
#' failure: `datom_schema_unsupported` for a too-new document,
#' `datom_schema_invalid` for an unusable value.
#'
#' @param meta Parsed document (a named list). A non-list or `NULL` is treated
#'   as carrying no `schema_version`, i.e. v1.
#' @param source Path or key of the document, used in the message so the user
#'   knows which file is too new.
#' @param operation What the caller was about to do -- `"read"` (default) or
#'   `"write"`. It only selects a word in the refusal message. An argument with
#'   a default rather than a required one, so that every existing call site and
#'   the message text they assert on are unchanged: without it a refused write
#'   said the format was one "this build cannot read", which is the wrong verb
#'   for a write that was stopped at the door.
#' @param supported Highest version this caller can interpret, defaulting to the
#'   repo-wide `.datom_supported_schema`. It feeds the comparison **and** the
#'   message, so a refusal never says "supports up to v2" while refusing a v2
#'   file.
#'
#'   The rule that predicts an override, so a future caller can derive it rather
#'   than remember it: a document **datom writes** takes the repo-wide ceiling; a
#'   document that outlives the build that created it and is then **edited by
#'   hand** gets its own. The shared number holds while every document on it is
#'   machine-written by one build in one operation. `.datom/project.yaml` is not
#'   -- it is stamped once at init and hand-edited afterwards -- so it carries
#'   `.datom_project_schema` and is checked through
#'   [.datom_check_project_schema()], which is where that pairing lives.

#' Check `project.yaml`'s Declared Format
#'
#' The same reader-side check every other datom-owned document gets, pinned to
#' the config file's own ceiling (`.datom_project_schema`) rather than the
#' repo-wide one. Absent means v1, which is every repo written so far, so no
#' existing repo changes behaviour.
#'
#' **Why the file needs a declared format at all.** `project.yaml` carries fields
#' a writer must *obey*, not merely fields it may read: `min_writer_version`
#' already, and `mode` / `set` for a product repo. A build that does not
#' recognise such a field walks past it and acts as though the repo had never
#' asked for anything -- so the file needs a way to say "this repo needs a newer
#' datom", and a number is that way.
#'
#' **A number here, a vocabulary check there, and the two are not
#' interchangeable.** The vocabulary check that guards the manifest and
#' per-artifact metadata draws its power from those documents being
#' machine-written: an unrecognised key there *is* evidence a newer datom wrote
#' it. `project.yaml` is hand-edited -- storage migrations, prefixes,
#' descriptions, private notes -- so an unrecognised key is as likely a typo, and
#' refusing on one would block every write in the repo until somebody found it.
#' Never point the vocabulary check at this file; an unrecognised key here stays
#' tolerated, and there is a test that says so.
#'
#' **This wrapper exists so the pairing of file and ceiling cannot be forgotten.**
#' A bare `supported =` argument at each call site is the same shape as the
