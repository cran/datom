# The datom-sv1 set contract: canonical identity for a set payload.
#
# Sibling of R/hashable.R, which holds the datom-cv1 table contract. The two
# regimes share NO primitive -- not even `.datom_encode_numeric()` -- and that
# is deliberate:
#
#   * A set payload is text-only (no numbers, no booleans, no `null`), so there
#     is nothing numeric to encode.
#   * Every intermediate here is a fixed-width 32-byte digest, so concatenation
#     is unambiguous without length prefixes: h("a") || h("b") is 64 bytes and
#     cannot collide with h("ab") at 32.
#
# What the two regimes do share is the house construction -- hash the
# per-element digests, then hash their concatenation -- and
# `digest::digest(..., algo = "sha256", serialize = FALSE)`.
#
# THE ENCODING (normative form; byte rules also in dev/datom_sv1_reference.R)
#
#   h(x)       = sha256(x)
#
#   str(s)     = h( 0x01 || utf8(s) )
#   strset(v)  = h( 0x02 || concat( str(e) for e in sort(unique(v), radix) ) )
#   map(m)     = h( 0x03 || concat( str(k) || strset(m[k])
#                                   for k in sort(keys(m), radix) ) )
#
#   member(x)  = h( 0x04 || map(x.id) || map(x.tags) )
#   set(p)     = h( 0x05 || map(p.tags) || concat( sort(unique(
#                            member(m) for m in p.members ), radix) ) )
#
#   data_sha   = h( 0x06 || utf8("datom-sv1") || set(payload) )
#
# Three things about it are load-bearing and must not be "tidied":
#
#   1. NO SERIALIZER IS IN THE IDENTITY PATH. `data_sha` is a function of the
#      parsed-JSON data model, never of emitted bytes. Stored-byte integrity is
#      `document_sha`'s separate job, so `jsonlite` may format the stored file
#      however it likes. Identity and storage integrity never share a
#      dependency -- that is the whole point of the regime.
#   2. NO RUNTIME TYPE DISPATCH. Every position's shape is fixed by where it
#      sits, so the encoder never asks "what type is this?" and therefore
#      cannot have an unhandled answer.
#   3. EVERY COLLECTION IS SORTED AND DEDUPED -- tag keys, tag values, and
#      members alike, with no carve-out. Sorting is `method = "radix"`, i.e.
#      C-locale byte order, so it is locale-independent (the same reason
#      `.datom_compute_metadata_sha()` sorts that way). No Unicode
#      normalization is applied: NFC and NFD are different tags, because
#      normalization tables are versioned Unicode data and nothing versioned
#      belongs in an identity path.
#
# The published golden vectors freeze all of the above. Changing any byte rule
# is a conscious `datom-sv2` bump, not an edit.
#
# WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO: validate. Grammar enforcement with user-facing
# recourse (which key is wrong, what the allowed types are, whether two members
# share an `id` with conflicting tags) belongs to `.datom_validate_members()`
# and `datom_write_set()`, which are the only places that see a whole payload
# and a caller's intent. The refusals below are narrower: they exist because
# the value cannot be encoded at all (`NA`, a number, `null`) or because
# encoding it would silently drop content from identity (an unexpected field).


#' Hash Bytes for datom-sv1
#'
#' The single SHA-256 call of the `datom-sv1` regime. Returns **raw** bytes
#' rather than hex because every intermediate digest is concatenated into the
#' next hash input; hex would double the width and put a text encoding in the
#' identity path.
#'
#' @param bytes A raw vector.
#' @return A raw vector of 32 bytes.

#' Render a Digest as Lowercase Hex
#'
#' Used for the two places the specification names hex: the collation key for
#' member digests, and the final `data_sha` string. Byte order and lowercase-hex
#' C-locale order agree (`00`-`09` before `0a`-`0f`, digits before letters in
#' ASCII), so sorting either representation gives the same result -- hex is
#' named in the spec because it is what a reader can compare by eye.

#' Coerce a Parsed-JSON String Set to a Character Vector
#'
#' A tag value arrives in one of three spellings, all meaning the same thing:
#' a length-1 character vector (`"output"`), a longer character vector
#' (`c("safety", "efficacy")`), or -- after a JSON round trip with
#' `simplifyVector = FALSE` -- a list of length-1 strings. All three normalise
#' to a character vector here, which is what makes a single string and a
#' one-element array hash identically.
#'
#' `character(0)` and `list()` (the parsed form of `[]`) both normalise to the
#' empty set. Upstream, canonicalization drops a key whose value is empty -- "no
#' labels" is spelled by omitting the key -- so the encoder should never meet one.
#' It must not depend on that: an encoder whose correctness rests on an upstream
#' rule breaks silently the day that rule moves.
