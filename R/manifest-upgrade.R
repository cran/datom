# Manifest schema upgrade steps.
#
# EVERY FUNCTION IN THIS FILE IS FROZEN ONCE RELEASED. A step is written against
# documents that already exist unchanged in the world, so re-tuning one to a
# later shape converts them wrongly -- and the wrong conversion is silent,
# because the output is well-formed for the version it is no longer describing.
# Add a new step for a new adjacent pair; never edit a shipped one, not even to
# tidy it.
#
# TWO CONSEQUENCES OF THE STEP TABLE HOLDING THE FUNCTIONS THEMSELVES rather
# than their names. `.datom_manifest_upgrade_steps` is built when the namespace
# is built, so each entry is the function object as it stood at that moment.
#
#   1. A step must be DEFINED IN THIS FILE, above the table. DESCRIPTION has no
#      Collate field, so R sources `R/` alphabetically -- a step defined in a
#      file that sorts after this one does not exist yet when the table is
#      built, and the package fails to install. Keeping every step here is the
#      rule anyway; this is what enforces it.
#   2. Mocking a step function in a test DOES NOT REACH THE DISPATCHER, because
#      the dispatcher never looks the name up again. Mock the table instead --
#      `local_mocked_bindings(.datom_manifest_upgrade_steps = list("1" = ...))`
#      -- which is what the zero-steps-on-a-current-document test does. Worth
#      knowing because this spec requires proving a guard fails before trusting
#      it, and a probe that mocks the step passes while proving nothing.
#
# The shape of the chain: one function per adjacent version pair, applied in
# order by the dispatcher. A v1 document reaching a v3 build runs v1-to-v2 and
# then v2-to-v3. No direct v1-to-v3 function is ever written -- that needs one
# function per *pair* of versions rather than per step, grows with the square of
# the version count, and gives the two routes to the same shape somewhere to
# disagree.
#
# Reads apply the chain in memory and leave the file alone. Writes apply it,
# edit the result, and write it back with the reached version stamped. Neither
# ever stamps a version onto a document it did not convert first.


#' Upgrade a v1 Manifest to v2
#'
#' v1 is every manifest written before the artifact namespace existed: the
#' artifact list sits under `tables` and no entry declares what kind of artifact
#' it is. v2 renames that key to `artifacts` and types every entry with
#' `kind = "table"`, which is what all of them are -- sets did not exist.
#'
#' The rename is done **in place** (`names()` assignment rather than
#' add-then-remove), so the key keeps its position in the document and any
#' sibling key this build does not recognise survives untouched.
#'
#' A v1 document with no `tables` key at all is left with no artifact key. That
#' is deliberate: an absent key and an empty one are different states -- a
#' truncated document versus a repo with nothing in it -- and flattening them
#' here would destroy the distinction a later self-healing read depends on.
#'
#' **Frozen.** See the file header.
#'
#' @param manifest Parsed manifest document (a named list) declaring v1.
#' @return The same document in v2 shape. The version is stamped by
#'   [.datom_manifest_upgrade()], not here, so a step is never mistaken for the
#'   thing that records the result.

#' Apply Every Upgrade Step from a Declared Version to Current

#' The dispatcher. Runs each step from `declared` up to
#' `.datom_supported_schema` in order, then records the version it reached.
#'
#' `declared` is a parameter rather than something read off the document,
#' because the only correct source for it is
#' [.datom_check_schema_version()], which returns it after refusing a document
#' this build cannot convert. Taking it as an argument is what makes
#' "check first, then upgrade" structural: there is no way to call this without
#' having obtained the number from the check.
#'
#' Identity on a document already at the current version -- zero steps run. A
#' document declaring a version *above* current is returned untouched too, since
#' no step exists for it; that state is unreachable through the check, which
#' aborts first.

#' @param manifest Parsed manifest document (a named list).
