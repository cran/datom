# Reconstructing the artifact index from storage.
#
# The manifest is a projection: every fact in it is also recorded in the
# per-artifact documents it summarises. That is what makes this file possible,
# and it is the reason the manifest gets a survivable failure mode where
# per-artifact metadata gets none -- there is nothing to rebuild metadata from.
#
# TWO CONDITIONS BRING A READER HERE, and they are the same two that make a
# WRITER refuse (`.datom_check_write_entry()`): the document holds no artifact
# list this build can reach, or it declares a format above what this build
# supports. Same evidence, opposite responses. Reads limp, writes stop -- a
# reader that carries on gives one person one session's answers, while a writer
# that carries on leaves the repo wrong for everybody. Do not "unify" the two
# sides; the asymmetry is the design.
#
# A REBUILD IS IN MEMORY, FOR THIS SESSION, ALWAYS. It writes nothing -- not the
# clone's copy, not storage's. A reader holds storage credentials and no clone,
# so persisting is not available to the population this exists for; and a read
# that quietly rewrote a repo's index would be a far larger surprise than the
# one it is fixing. The recorded copy is repaired by the next ordinary write.
#
# IT IS NOT SILENT. Every rebuild warns once, naming the upgrade. A repair that
# succeeds without saying so is itself a silent degradation, which is the exact
# failure the whole schema contract exists to remove.
#
# ACCEPTED COST, RECORDED SO IT IS NOT MET AS A SURPRISE: nothing memoises this,
# so it runs again on every call for as long as the repo stays broken. One
# listing plus two reads per artifact means a 300-artifact repo spends ~601
# storage requests per command -- and `datom_status()` reads two copies of the
# manifest, so a repo broken on both sides pays twice in one call. That is the
# cost the manifest exists to avoid (`dev/datom_specification.md:1694`: "For
# repos with 100-300 tables, this avoids hundreds of S3 GETs on unchanged
# re-runs"), which is exactly why the trigger is a broken index rather than
# anything a healthy repo can hit. The user experiences it as datom hanging,
# because the warning only arrives once the work is finished.
#
# Not memoised on purpose. A session cache is already deferred package-wide
# pending its invalidation design (`dev/datom_specification.md:2031`), and adding
# one here would put session state into a library that has none in order to speed
# up a state the next ordinary write removes. Upgrading, or writing once, is the
# fix.


#' Artifact Names Present in Storage
#'
#' Enumerates artifacts from a storage listing, by the one signal that
#' identifies one: a `{name}/.metadata/metadata.json` object. Deliberately
#' independent of the manifest, because the manifest is the document under
#' suspicion whenever this is called.
#'
#' The clone-side equivalent is [.datom_clone_artifact_names()]. They are not
#' interchangeable and neither can stand in for the other: a storage-only reader
#' has no clone at all, and the clone can hold an artifact whose upload has not
#' happened yet.
#'
#' **The listing returns FULL keys** -- including the `{prefix}/datom/` portion
#' -- while every other part of datom's business logic speaks in keys relative to
#' the datom namespace root. Mixing the two shapes double-prefixes silently and
#' does not error, so the root is stripped here, once, against the same builder
#' the backends use.
#'
#' @param conn A `datom_conn` object.
#' @return Character vector of artifact names, possibly empty. One storage
#'   listing, recursive.

#' The Version Storage Recorded for an Artifact's Current State
#'
#' Picks the `version_history.json` entry that describes `metadata.json`, and
#' returns the `version` **recorded** on it.
#'
#' **Never recomputed, and that is the point of this function existing at all.**
#' Hashing `metadata.json` here would reach for the identity code in precisely
#' the scenario a rebuild is for -- a repo touched by a build whose field
#' classification differs from this one's -- and publish a `current_version`
#' matching no version in the recorded history. An index pointing at a version
#' that does not exist is worse than the empty list it replaced.
#'
#' Which entry describes the current state is not simply the newest one. History
#' is prepended newest-first, but a write that reverts to content already in the
#' history appends nothing, so the current state can be an older entry. The
#' selection therefore narrows by recorded fields only:
#'
#' 1. Entries whose `data_sha` equals the current document's. One match settles
#'    it -- this is the revert case, and it is why the newest entry alone is
#'    wrong.
#' 2. Several matches means metadata-only versions of the same content; the one
#'    whose `timestamp` equals the document's `created_at` is the current one,
#'    since a version's history entry copies that field verbatim.
#' 3. Anything still ambiguous takes the newest candidate. That is a choice
#'    between two entries that both describe the current **content**, so the
#'    worst case is naming the wrong one of two versions of the same bytes.
#'
#' **No match at all returns `NULL`, and it deliberately does not fall back to
#' the newest entry.** No match means the history does not record the state
#' `metadata.json` describes -- a truncated or partly-synced history. The newest
#' entry there is a version of *different content*, so naming it would be a wrong
#' statement rather than a missing one, and a row already tolerates carrying no
#' version. `datom_validate()` owns the inconsistency. This is the same trade the
#' carry-forward rule makes in `R/forward-compat.R`: a stale claim that outlives
#' what it described is worse than an absent one.
#'
#' @param meta The artifact's parsed `metadata.json`.
#' @param history The artifact's parsed `version_history.json`, a list of
#'   entries, or `NULL`.
#' @return The recorded version string, or `NULL` when the history records
#'   nothing usable -- in which case the rebuilt row simply carries no version,
#'   rather than a manufactured one.

#' Rebuild One Artifact's Manifest Row from Its Own Documents
#'
#' Every field on the row is copied from `metadata.json`, counted from

#' The row's shape has to match what `.datom_update_manifest_entry()` writes,
#' field for field, or a rebuilt repo answers differently from a healthy one -- so
#' the two are pinned against each other by a test rather than by matching
#' comments.
#'
#' `last_updated` is the one field with no recorded source: the writer stamps the
#' wall clock at the moment it rewrites the row, and that moment is not in any

#' true statement available -- when this artifact's current state was written.
