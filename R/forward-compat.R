# Forward compatibility: keeping a document readable and writable by builds that
# do not know its full shape.
#
# The problem this file exists for. A datom-owned document can arrive carrying a
# top-level field this build has never heard of -- a collaborator on a newer
# datom wrote it and this developer pulled. Datom's write path does not edit such
# a document in place; it rebuilds it from scratch from what it knows and
# overwrites the file. So an older build does not merely miscompute around the
# unfamiliar field: it DELETES it. Every field datom writes today happens to be
# recomputable from data it still holds, so nothing is lost yet; the rule exists
# for the first field that is not.
#
# Nothing here can be retrofitted. A build already installed and pinned in an
# renv.lock will keep deleting fields it does not know, because the preserving
# has to happen inside the build doing the writing. That is why this ships now
# rather than when a non-recomputable field first appears.


#' Every Metadata Field Name This Build Knows
#'
#' The two halves of the classification joined: the fields that make up a
#' version's identity, and the fields datom deliberately keeps out of it. A name
#' in neither half is a name this build cannot place.
#'
#' A function rather than a stored vector, for two reasons that both bite.
#' `R/` is sourced alphabetically (DESCRIPTION declares no `Collate`), and this
#' file sorts before `R/utils-sha.R` where both halves are defined -- so a
#' constant built from them here would be built from values that do not exist
#' yet and the package would fail to install. Deriving it at call time also means
#' it cannot fall out of step with either half.
#'
#' **Append-only.** A name that has ever been written must keep classifying
#' forever, including names datom no longer writes: a build that forgets one
#' meets an older document, fails to place a field it should know, and starts
#' preserving as unfamiliar something it could have handled -- or, once the
#' write-side refusal lands, refuses the document outright and blocks the
#' upgrade direction, which must always work.

#
# Kept as its own list rather than derived from the row builder, because the

# output could never disagree with a vocabulary read off that same output. The

#' Carry Unrecognised Top-Level Fields Onto a Rebuilt Document
#'
#' Copies onto `rebuilt` every top-level field of `prior` whose name is not in
#' `known`, so a field this build cannot place survives being rewritten.
#'
#' **Only unrecognised fields are carried, and that narrowness is the design.**
#' A field datom knows about keeps exactly the behaviour it has today, including
#' disappearing when this write does not set it. `original_format` is the case
#' that makes the difference concrete: a table first imported from a CSV and
#' later written straight from a data frame has no format to declare, and the
#' row is meant to stop claiming one. Carrying every absent field forward
#' instead of only the unplaceable ones would leave that claim standing against
#' a version it does not describe -- a wrong statement, which is worse than a
#' missing one.
#'
#' Where `rebuilt` already has a field, `rebuilt` wins. That cannot happen for a
#' genuinely unrecognised field, since this build only writes names it knows;
#' stating the precedence costs one term and removes the question.
#'
#' Top-level only, at each level separately. A field nested inside a value datom
#' does understand -- inside `custom`, or inside the manifest's `summary` block
#' -- is not this function's business: `custom` is carried whole as one
#' recognised field, and `summary` is a derived aggregate that is meant to be
#' recomputed.
#'
#' A field whose value is JSON `null` gets no special handling. Absence in a
#' datom document is spelled by omitting the key, never by nulling it, so such a
#' field is already off-convention; it is carried, but a `null` re-serialises as
#' an empty object rather than as `null`.
#'
#' @param rebuilt The document this build assembled, a named list.
#' @param prior The document that was already on disk, a named list, or `NULL` /
#'   anything unparsed when there was none -- in which case there is nothing to

# --- The write entry -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# Carrying an unfamiliar field forward (above) keeps a write from destroying
# information. It does not make the write CORRECT. A build that meets a field it
# cannot place has been handed a document by a newer datom, and it would go on to
# recompute that document's version identity from the fields it does know --
# reaching a different answer from the build that wrote it, on content that never
# moved. So the write stops instead.
#
# Reads limp, writes stop. That asymmetry is deliberate and it runs through the
# whole schema design: a reader that guesses wrong gives one wrong answer to one
# person, while a writer that guesses wrong leaves the repo wrong for everybody.
#
# Everything in this section runs BEFORE any hashing, any local file write and
# any commit, so a refusal leaves nothing half-written. A write is several steps
# -- local files, one commit, then the storage mirror -- and stopping halfway
# through is worse than the disagreement being prevented.
#
# ALL OF IT READS THE CLONE, never storage. The clone is the copy being
# overwritten, reading it costs no network round trip, it is where a pull from a
# collaborator on a newer datom lands, and storage cannot legitimately be ahead
# of git because git is written first and gates the mirror.

#' Refuse a Write This Repo Has Declared Too Old
#'
#' A repo may state the lowest version of datom it accepts writes from. The
#' field is optional and lives in `project.yaml`; **absent means no limit**, so
#' no repo written so far changes behaviour.
#'
#' It exists for the two cases the vocabulary check structurally cannot see,
#' because neither introduces a new field name: a change in what an existing
#' field *means*, and a block for a reason that is not about format at all
#' ("0.1.4 wrote bad hashes, do not let it write here"). A version number is the
#' right currency for both -- the schema number cannot carry them, since it does
#' not move for a change that is reader-safe, and a package version directly
#' answers the question a refusal raises.
#'
#' **The reading half ships even though nothing sets the field yet**, and that
#' ordering is the whole point: a build that does not look for the field can
#' never be bound by it. This is exactly why no released datom can be stopped
#' from writing -- the looking has to be inside the build being stopped. Setting
#' the field is a separate, later mechanism, and it owns the guard that whoever
#' raises a floor must already satisfy it.
#'

#' Refuse a Document Carrying a Field This Build Cannot Place
#'
#' Compares one document's **top-level** key names against the names this build
#' can classify, and aborts naming any it cannot. The evidence is in the file:
#' no version comparison, no configuration, no network.
#'
#' Chosen over a declared version floor as the *primary* mechanism for one
#' reason -- **it cannot be forgotten.** A floor protects a repo only if somebody
#' remembers to raise it; this fires on the evidence whether or not anyone did
#' anything.
#'
#' **Top-level keys only, and that is a scope rather than a shortcut.** It means
#' do not descend into a value -- `custom` holds arbitrary user keys by design
#' and is classified as one recognised field, and the manifest's `summary` block
#' is a derived aggregate that is rebuilt on every write. It does **not** mean
#' skip the manifest's artifact entries: an entry is its own document for this
#' purpose and gets checked against its own vocabulary.
#'
#' **The check cannot fire on the upgrade path**, and no code guards against
#' that: a newer build's vocabulary is a superset of every older build's, so it
#' can never meet a name it does not know. A directional special case would be
#' dead code protecting an unreachable state.
#'
#' The accepted cost is that any release adding a field to a datom-owned document

#' Everything a Write Must Clear Before It Starts
#'
#' The one entry sequence for every write route. Ordered, and the order matters:
#'
#' 1. **The floor** -- refuse if this repo has declared this build too old.
#' 2. **The manifest, read through the one shared reader**, which checks the
#'    declared format and then converts an older document in memory. Refusing a
#'    format from the future has to happen before the conversion, because there
#'    is no conversion step for a version this build has never heard of.
#' 3. **The shape the conversion reached.** If the artifact list is still absent
#'    after the chain has run, this document belongs to a lineage this build
#'    cannot produce -- refuse rather than overwrite it in an older shape.
#' 4. **The vocabulary**, on the manifest's top level, on each of its artifact
#'    entries, and on each per-artifact metadata document this write will touch.
#'
#' **Why step 3 is worded as "still absent after the chain" and not "absent".**
#' A current build meeting a pre-rename repo finds no artifact list either, and a
#' rule that refused on that would deadlock the very upgrade it exists to
#' protect: no repo could ever move forward. The discriminator is not the key, it
#' is whether the chain can *reach* the shape. Note the deliberate asymmetry with
#' the reader, which will one day *rebuild* on this same condition -- same
#' evidence, opposite response, because reads limp and writes stop.
#'
#' **Which per-artifact documents get checked depends on the route**, which is
#' why `artifact` exists. A table write or a metadata-only sync touches one
#' artifact; the mirror-everything route touches all of them, and it is the route
#' with no artifact name in its arguments at all. Both cases enumerate through
#' [.datom_clone_artifact_names()], the same helper the mirror route itself uses,
#' so the door cannot end up inspecting a different set than the one that gets
#' written.
#'
#' **Callable more than once, and one route calls it twice.** Nothing here
#' mutates anything, so re-running it is free. The metadata-only route pulls from
#' the remote as its first act -- after this check has already read the clone --
#' so a collaborator's newer document can arrive in that pull; that route runs
