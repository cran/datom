# Editing a set that already exists: selecting members already in hand, then
# repointing them at newer versions or dropping them.
#
# WHY VERBS RATHER THAN LIST SURGERY. The only route before these was editing
# the list `datom_get_set()` returned, and two of the obvious spellings are
# silently wrong. Filtering members by name drops EVERY version of that name, so
# a deliberately frozen baseline goes out with the live table. And rebuilding a
# pointer from its name plus a new version loses that member's labels, which are
# part of the set's content -- so the set's identity moves for a reason nobody
# asked for.
#
# THE TWO VERBS ARE ASYMMETRIC IN WHAT THEY NEED, AND THAT IS FORCED. Removing
# has to FIND a pointer already in hand, so it takes no connection and does no
# IO; repointing has to RESOLVE one, so it takes a connection per project. Their
# defaults are opposite for the same kind of reason: an idempotent refresh
# defaults to every member, a destructive verb defaults to nothing.
#
# FIVE THINGS HERE ARE LOAD-BEARING.
#
#   1. LABELS ARE CARRIED, NEVER REBUILT. `datom_member()` tidies the tag map it
#      is handed -- a key whose value is empty is dropped -- so passing the old
#      labels back through it can return fewer labels than it was given. The
#      pointer is therefore built with NO tags and the old record's `tags` is
#      attached verbatim afterwards. Every datom-written payload is tidied
#      already, which is exactly why this is invisible in an ordinary fixture and
#      shows up only on a hand-built or foreign-written set.
#
#   2. THE `fetch` LINK IS REBUILT FOR EVERY MEMBER THAT HAD ONE. A link pins the
#      version it was built at. Move the record's version and leave the link
#      alone and the member contradicts itself: `id` says the new version and
#      `$fetch()` returns the old data, silently. The rebuild goes through the
#      one existing factory, never inline -- a closure built in this file would
#      put the frame holding `conn`, and therefore the PAT, on its parent chain.
#
#   3. CONNECTIONS ARE MATCHED ON AN UNVERIFIED LABEL AND THE RESULT IS
#      VERIFIED. `conn$project_name` is a string the caller supplied and nothing
#      compares it against the repo, so it can only choose the route. What
#      confirms the route is the REBUILT member's recorded project: it comes from
#      the artifact's own metadata, so a connection labelled for one project
#      while pointing at another's storage is caught after the read rather than
#      trusted before it.
#
#   4. UNKNOWN REFUSES, KNOWN-AND-BENIGN REPORTS. No connection for a member's
#      project means whether it moved is unknowable, so the whole call stops --
#      reporting it as unchanged would state something nothing checked. An
#      artifact that no longer appears in its project is a known answer, so it is
#      reported and its pin is left: a version is immutable and still reads, and
#      refusing a whole refresh over one retired input is the wrong trade.
#
#   5. NOTHING IS WRITTEN, SO THE REPORT IS THE DRY RUN. Both facts follow from
#      it: no confirmation prompt is needed, and a refresh that finds nothing new
#      returns a byte-identical payload, which the existing change detection
#      reports as no change with no version minted.

#' Which Members Does This Call Refer To?
#'
#' The plural selector both edit verbs share. [.datom_find_member()] resolves
#' exactly **one** member and aborts on an ambiguous name, which is right for a
#' fetch and only half of what an edit needs: an edit legitimately acts on many.
#'
#' Three routes, and the difference between them is how many members they can
#' return:
#'
#' | What arrives | What comes back |
#' |---|---|
#' | no `member` | every member, narrowed by `tags` and `version` |
#' | a name | exactly one, aborting when the name is ambiguous |
#' | a record or a link | exactly the member carrying that `id` |
#'
#' **An explicitly named member that is ambiguous aborts**, and that is not in
#' tension with the caller who sweeps: a sweep can honour "refresh everything"
#' while skipping a name it cannot choose between, whereas a caller who named one
#' member asked for something that cannot be done, so it is a user error and the
#' narrowing arguments are what resolve it. The abort comes from
#' [.datom_find_member()] rather than from a second copy of that message.
#'
#' `tags` and `version` narrow a **name** or a sweep. Supplied beside a record or
#' a link they are refused rather than ignored, because ignoring them would act
#' on a different member than the one asked for and report success.

#' The Commit Message a Set Write Uses
#'
#' A set write commits `Update {name}`, which says nothing in `git log`. When the
#' object being written carries an edit log and the caller passed no `message`, the
#' default names what changed instead -- every action in the log, so a chained
#' `update |> remove` produces one message describing both.
#'
#' Two messages, because they go to two places. The **subject** is recorded as the
#' version's `commit_message`, where one line is what [datom_history()] can show.
#' The **commit** gets the subject plus the full list, with whole versions rather
#' than prefixes: git is the durable record, so completeness belongs there rather
#' than on screen.

#' rather than trusted -- it is an attribute, so a caller can put anything there.
#'
#' @param name The set's name.
#' @param message The caller's `message`, or `NULL`.

# --- the verb ---------------------------------------------------------------------

#' Repoint a Set's Members at Newer Versions
#'
#' Moves members of a set forward to the versions that are current now, and
#' returns the set with those pointers changed. **Nothing is written**: the
#' report you see is the dry run, and the set is stored only when you pass the
#' result to [datom_write_set()].
#'
#' This is the operation a product needs when its inputs move on -- a hundred
#' members of which thirty upstream tables have advanced. Doing it by hand is
#' list surgery on what [datom_get_set()] returned, and two of the obvious
#' spellings are silently wrong: filtering members by name drops *every* version
#' of that name, and rebuilding a pointer from its name plus a new version drops
#' that member's labels.
#'
#' @section Which connection to pass:
#' One per project the set spans, since access in datom is per project. A set
#' whose members all live in the project that owns it needs only that one
#' connection; a product drawing on three studies needs three, in a list.
#'
#' A set's projects can be listed **offline, with no connection at all**:
#'
#' ```r
#' unique(datom_list_members(x)$project)
#' ```
#'
#' @section Which members move:
#' With no `member`, **every** member -- refreshing everything is the common case
#' and rerunning it changes nothing. Otherwise select one the way
#' [datom_fetch_member()] does: by name, by a member record, or by a link. `tags`
#' and `version_from` narrow either a name or the sweep, so
#' `tags = list(release = "live")` repoints the labelled members and leaves the
#' rest pinned.
#'
#' A name that matches more than one member **aborts**, because the request
#' cannot be honoured as typed; a *sweep* that meets the same pair skips it and
#' says so, because refusing a whole refresh over one frozen baseline would make
#' the first update on such a set an error.
#'
#' @section Which version each member moves to:
#' `version_to` omitted, each selected member moves to the version its own
#' project reports as current, and every move is reported before anything is
#' written. That is the one place datom infers "newest", and the reason it is
#' allowed here is in the verb's name: a pointer *constructor* requires an
#' explicit version ([datom_member()] refuses to guess), while a verb whose whole
#' meaning is *move this forward* states the time-dependence up front and then
#' says what it picked. What the set records is still an exact version, so a
#' script that later reads that set is as reproducible as ever.
#'
#' `version_to` supplied, the selected member moves to exactly that version --
#' a rollback to a known-good, or a deliberate step to something that is not the
#' newest. It requires the selection to resolve to one member, because one
#' explicit version across several artifacts is not a meaning. It is also what
#' makes this verb better than removing and re-adding a member: **the labels come
#' with it**, where re-adding makes you retype them.
#'
#' @section What it declines to do, and how:
#' | Situation | Response |
#' |---|---|
#' | a member's project has no supplied connection | the whole call is refused, naming that project |
#' | a member's artifact no longer appears in its project | reported, and its pin is left alone |
#' | two members share a name and a project | both skipped and reported |
#'
#' The first refuses because whether those members moved is unknowable, and
#' reporting them as unchanged would state something nothing checked. The second
#' does not, because the answer *is* known: the pinned version is immutable and
#' still reads, so the set stays writable.
#'
#' @section What comes back:
#' The set it was handed, with matching members repointed and each moved
#' member's labels byte-identical to what they were.
#'
#' When something moved, a `datom_set`'s `version` and `data_sha` are emptied:
#' they described the payload it was read as, and that is no longer what the
#' object holds. When nothing moved they are left alone, because the object still
#' describes exactly that stored version.
#'
#' The returned object also carries a log of what changed, which
#' [datom_write_set()] uses for the commit message when you pass no `message` of
#' your own -- so `git log` names what moved instead of saying `Update {name}`.
#' [datom_remove_members()] adds to the same log, so editing both ways before you
#' write produces one message describing both. Passing `x$members` rather than `x`
#' to the write loses that and nothing else.
#'
#' @param x A `datom_set`, from [datom_get_set()] or [datom_assemble_set()].
#' @param conn A `datom_conn` from [datom_get_conn()], or a list of them -- one
#'   per project the selected members belong to.
#' @param member Optional: the member to repoint, as its name, a member record,
#'   or a link. `NULL` (the default) selects every member.
#' @param tags Optional named list of labels narrowing the selection, e.g.
#'   `list(type = "input")`. A member matches when it carries every label listed.
#' @param version_from Optional version, or a prefix of one, narrowing the
#'   selection to the member pinned at it.
#' @param version_to Optional exact version to move to. `NULL` (the default)
#'   means whatever that artifact's project reports as current. Requires the
#'   selection to resolve to a single member.
#'
#' @return `x` with the matching members repointed, and what changed appended to
#'   its `datom_edits` attribute.
#' @seealso [datom_remove_members()] to drop members instead,
#'   [datom_write_set()] to store the result, [datom_list_members()] to see what a
#'   set holds, [datom_member()] to build a pointer from scratch.

#' Drop Members from a Set
#'
#' Removes the members you select and returns the set without them. **Nothing is
#' written**: the object comes back edited, and the set is stored only when you
#' pass the result to [datom_write_set()].
#'
#' It exists because the hand-rolled version is silently wrong. Filtering a
#' member list by name drops **every** version of that name, so a set holding a
#' live table beside a deliberately frozen baseline loses both; removing by
#' position removes a different member the day somebody adds one.
#'
#' @section Why there is no connection argument:
#' Not an oversight. Removing a member only has to **find** a pointer the set
#' already holds, while adding or repointing one has to **resolve** it -- read the
#' artifact's metadata, confirm its kind, record the project that wrote it. So
#' this verb does no IO at all and needs no credentials, which is also why it is
#' the one edit verb that works on a set read through a storage-only connection
#' with no clone.
#'
#' @section Selecting what to drop:
#' A selection is **required**. `datom_remove_members(x)` would mean removing
#' every member, which the writer refuses anyway, so it aborts instead of building
#' a payload the write then rejects. The safe default for a destructive verb is
#' nothing -- the opposite of [datom_update_members()], where the safe default is
#' everything because a refresh is idempotent.
#'
#' Select by name, by a member record, or by a link, and narrow with `tags` or
#' `version`; `tags` or `version` on their own select every member they match, so
#' `tags = list(status = "draft")` drops the labelled ones.
#'
#' Three things it refuses rather than doing quietly:
#'
#' | What you asked for | Why it stops |
#' |---|---|
#' | a name matching more than one member | that is the silently-wrong spelling this verb replaces -- it would drop a frozen baseline along with the live table |
#' | a selection matching nothing | it is a typo, and `Filter()` reports success for it |
#' | every member | a set with no members cannot be written, and the refusal belongs on the line that emptied it |
#'
#' **An ambiguous name refuses here while [datom_update_members()] skips it**, and
#' the asymmetry is the consequence rather than a taste: skipping a repoint leaves
#' a valid pinned version behind, while skipping a removal silently does nothing at
#' all.
#'
#' @param x A `datom_set`, from [datom_get_set()] or [datom_assemble_set()].
#' @param member The member to drop, as its name, a member record, or a link.
#'   Optional only when `tags` or `version` selects on its own.
#' @param tags Optional named list of labels selecting members, e.g.
#'   `list(status = "draft")`. A member matches when it carries every label
#'   listed.
#' @param version Optional version, or a prefix of one, selecting the members
#'   pinned at it.
#'
#' @return `x` without the selected members, its `version` and `data_sha` emptied
#'   because they described a payload it no longer holds, and what was dropped
#'   appended to its `datom_edits` attribute -- which [datom_write_set()] turns
