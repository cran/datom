#' Resolve Version to data_sha, Stored-Object Hash and Recorded Version
#'
#' Given metadata from [.datom_read_metadata()], resolves a version spec
#' to the corresponding `data_sha` (the storage address), the recorded
#' stored-object integrity hash, and the version string as **recorded**. If
#' `version` is NULL, resolves from the current `metadata.json`; if a
#' metadata_sha string (or a prefix of one), looks it up in
#' `version_history.json`.
#'
#' **One function, two kinds, one `field` argument.** A table's stored object is
#' a parquet file pinned by `parquet_sha`; a set's is a JSON payload pinned by
#' `document_sha`. The question is identical either way -- *which recorded hash
#' pins the version I just resolved* -- so a second copy of this lookup would
#' eventually disagree with this one about prefix matching or about what an
#' absent hash means. The resolved hash comes back as `object_sha` regardless,
#' because the caller already knows which field it asked for.
#'
#' The `object_sha` may be `NULL`/`""`, and what that means is the caller's to
#' decide, not this function's. For a table it is **pre-cv1 metadata** and tells
#' [.datom_read_parquet()] to skip the integrity check -- a grace for legacy
#' metadata, not a gap in the current writer. For a set there is no legacy
#' population, so the set read treats it as an error.
#'
#' `version` is the version **recorded** for the resolved state, never
#' recomputed: a pinned read echoes the matched history entry's own version
#' string (so a caller who passed an 8-character prefix gets the full one back),
#' and an unpinned read takes the current state's recorded version via
#' [.datom_recorded_current_version()]. That helper returns `NULL` when the
#' history records nothing matching the current document, which is a gap
#' `datom_validate()` owns -- a manufactured version would be a wrong statement
#' rather than a missing one.
#'
#' @param metadata_list Return value of [.datom_read_metadata()].
#' @param version NULL (current) or a metadata_sha string / prefix.
#' @param name Artifact name (for error messages).

#'   -- see `.datom_metadata_excluded_fields`.

#'   Why the writer records it at all: a **reader** connection's `project_name`

#' Build the Metadata Document for a Set Write
#'
#' A set's `metadata.json` is a collapsed version of a table's: `schema_version`,
#' `kind`, `data_sha`, `hash_algo`, `document_sha`, `project`, `created_at`,
#' `datom_version`, and no more. Everything a table carries that describes a
#' rectangle (`nrow`,
#' `ncol`, `colnames`), the provenance axis (`table_type`,
#' `parents`, `source_lineage`), the stored-parquet facts (`parquet_sha`,
#' `size_bytes`) and the user-metadata channel (`custom`) are all **omitted, not
#' nulled** -- a set's members and its user metadata both live in the payload as
#' tags, and no counter reads a set's byte size.
#'
#' Kept beside [.datom_build_metadata()] on purpose: the two documents are close
#' enough that a field copied from the wrong one is easy to miss, and two of the
#' values here are exactly that kind of trap.
#'
#' * `data_sha` comes from [.datom_canonical_set_hash()], the `datom-sv1`
#'   identity engine, **not** from the table hash. Computed here rather than
#'   passed in, so a caller cannot hand a set a table-regime hash.
#' * `hash_algo` is the literal `"datom-sv1"`. The encoder embeds that string
#'   inside the digest but nothing stamps the field, so the builder must. A
#'   copied `"datom-cv1"` would leave a set claiming one regime while hashing
#'   under the other, and no hash comparison would notice.
#'
#' @param payload The set payload: a list with `members` (an unnamed list of
#'   member records) and optional set-level `tags`. Must already be tidied and
#'   validated -- this builder hashes what it is given.
#' @param document_sha SHA-256 of the stored payload bytes, or NULL. Declared
#'   either way, mirroring how [.datom_build_metadata()] declares `parquet_sha`
#'   for [datom_write()] to populate: the byte hash is not knowable until the
#'   payload has been serialized, and it is excluded from `metadata_sha`, so the
#'   deferred assignment cannot move a version. **Nothing computes one until the
#'   set write path exists**, so today it arrives NULL from every caller.
#'
#'   **The write path must populate it before writing the document.** `jsonlite`
#'   does not omit a NULL element -- it writes `{}`, which reads back as an empty
#'   list rather than an absent key. `parquet_sha` never hits this because its
#'   only two outcomes are a real hash or `meta$parquet_sha <- NULL`, and
#'   assigning NULL *removes* the element. A field left declared-and-unpopulated
#'   through a write would satisfy a names-only field-set check while carrying an
#'   empty object, so assert on the written bytes where the field set matters.
#' @param project The name of the project whose namespace this set is being
#'   written into, from the writing repo's own `.datom/project.yaml`. Same field
#'   and same only-when-non-NULL treatment as [.datom_build_metadata()]'s
#'   `project`.
#' @return Named list of exactly the fields a set's `metadata.json` carries,

#' Refuse to Write One Kind of Artifact Over Another
#'
#' One name means one artifact, whatever its kind, because both kinds store
#' everything under `{name}/` -- a set named `dm` beside a table named `dm` would
#' write the same `dm/.metadata/metadata.json` and each would clobber the other.
#'
#' **Checked against the metadata document in storage, not against the
#' manifest.** The manifest is a projection and can lag behind a write that got
#' partway through, so it can say a name is free when it is not. The document is
#' also the copy [.datom_has_changes()] has just read, so the comparison costs no
#' extra round trip -- which is why the current document is passed in rather than
#' fetched here.
#'
#' An absent `kind` reads as `"table"`: every document written before the field
#' existed describes a table, because sets did not exist. The pairing with a
#' format check is not needed here the way it is in `datom_member()` -- a document
#' from a future datom has already been refused at the write entry, and on the
#' read path [.datom_read_metadata()] has just checked the same document.
#'
#' **Both directions of the same invariant, in one function.** A read that meets
#' the other kind needs different words and a different suggested verb from a
#' write that does, which `operation` selects -- following
#' [.datom_check_schema_version()], which took exactly that shape for exactly
#' this reason. A separate read-side twin would let the two directions drift,
#' each passing its own tests, while the rule they enforce is single: **one name
#' is one artifact**. For the same reason both aborts carry one condition class,
#' so no test can key on one direction alone.

#' Resolve the parquet_sha to Record and Whether to Upload
#'
#' For a write that is not a no-op, decides which `parquet_sha` the new metadata
#' should carry and whether the freshly-serialized parquet bytes need uploading.
#' The caller performs the actual upload AFTER the git push (git push is the
#' serialization point); this function only decides.
#'
#' Cases:
#' * `metadata_only` -- the `data_sha` is unchanged, so the parquet object
#'   already exists; carry forward the current metadata's `parquet_sha` (which
#'   may be NULL for a pre-cv1 table, leaving the integrity check skipped) and
#'   do not upload.
#' * `full` where a prior version already recorded a `parquet_sha` for this
#'   exact `data_sha` -- the stored object exists and is pinned by that version;
#'   reuse its `parquet_sha` and do NOT re-upload (a fresh serialization can
#'   differ byte-for-byte and would break that version's integrity pin).
#' * `full` otherwise (brand-new content, or a legacy object with no recorded
#'   `parquet_sha`) -- upload these bytes and record their hash.
#'
#' This refines the design's literal step 7 (which gated on
#' `.datom_storage_exists()`): a recorded `parquet_sha` is the precise thing we
#' must not clobber, and its presence implies the object exists, so the history
#' lookup subsumes the existence check with identical behavior and one fewer
