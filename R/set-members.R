# Finding and shaping a set's members: three verbs over the object
# `datom_get_set()` returns.
#
# NONE OF THESE READS A DOCUMENT THE SET READ DID NOT ALREADY READ.
# `datom_fetch_member()` performs exactly the reads `datom_read()` /
# `datom_get_set()` perform, because it resolves the pointer through the same
# link core `$fetch` is built from. The other two do no IO at all -- they are
# pure functions of the set object plus a caller-supplied axis, which is what
# keeps them from being a stored view configuration.
#
# FOUR THINGS HERE ARE LOAD-BEARING AND EASY TO UNDO BY TIDYING.
#
#   1. THERE IS ONE EXPANDER, IT READS A TAG MAP BY POSITION, AND BOTH SHAPING
#      VERBS GO THROUGH IT.
#      `datom_list_members()` turns one member into one row per tag value;
#      `datom_structure_members()` turns one member into one leaf per axis
#      value. That is the same operation, and writing it twice is what invites
#      the silent spelling -- taking the FIRST value of a multi-valued tag
#      (`m$tags[[by]][1]`), which puts a member under one branch when it belongs
#      under several. With one expander there is no second place to write it.
#
#      THE BY-POSITION HALF IS NOT A DETAIL, and it was added after the first
#      version of this file shipped with the defect. A tag map can carry the same
#      key twice -- nothing on the read side refuses one, and `jsonlite` parses
#      duplicate JSON keys into two same-named elements -- and `tags[[k]]`
#      returns the first match every time. So a by-name read is the identical
#      silent-first-match failure one level up, on the KEY axis instead of the
#      value axis, written inside the very function that exists to have one
#      place for it. Every read of a member's tag values goes through
#      `.datom_tag_pairs()` for that reason, `.datom_member_has_tags()`
#      included.
#
#   2. A MULTI-VALUED AXIS PUTS ONE MEMBER UNDER SEVERAL BRANCHES. That is the
#      whole reason labels exist here rather than folders: a folder holds an item
#      once, a tag can hold it twice. So the leaf count legitimately exceeds the
#      member count, and any change that makes those two numbers agree has
#      broken the feature rather than tidied it.
#
#   3. A MEMBER IS NEVER SILENTLY DROPPED AND A LEAF NAME IS NEVER SILENTLY
#      REUSED. A member missing the axis key goes under a named bucket; two
#      members asking for one leaf name abort. Both refusals exist because the
#      alternative -- a member the consumer cannot find and cannot see is absent
#      -- is the failure a projection is most likely to hide.
#
#   4. THE PROJECT CHECK IS A HINT ON FAILURE, NEVER A GATE, and it does not
#      live in this file. It sits in the link core in `R/set.R`, because after
#      `datom_structure_members()` a leaf is a link: a hint implemented in
#      `datom_fetch_member()` alone would miss the route people actually use.

#' The Member List of a Set, or an Abort Naming What Was Passed
#'
#' Every verb in this file starts here, so "this is not a set" is reported once
#' and identically rather than surfacing as a `$` on a data frame returning NULL.
#'
#' A set with no members is **not** an error. The writer refuses an empty member
#' list, but the reader does not -- a hand-built payload, or one from a newer
#' datom, reads back with none -- so every verb below has to have an answer for
#' zero members.
#'
#' @param x The value the caller passed.
#' @param arg Argument name for the message.
#' @return The member list, possibly empty.

#' One `id` Field as Text, or `NA`
#'
#' A member read by [datom_get_set()] always has four single-string `id` fields
#' -- the read refuses a payload where one is not. This exists for the other
#' input: a `datom_set` assembled by hand, which is supported and untrusted. `NA`
#' rather than an abort so a listing still shows the member; the abort belongs to
#' whoever tries to *resolve* it.

#' A Tag Value as a Plain Character Vector
#'
#' **This is only possible because the tag grammar is text-only.**
#' [.datom_validate_tag_map()] refuses numbers, booleans, `null` and nesting, so
#' a tag value is a character vector and the `value` column of a member listing
#' is a plain character column with no list-column anywhere. If the grammar ever
#' widened, this function and the long format above it are what would have to
#' change.
#'
#' The two shapes handled are the two a value legitimately arrives in: a
#' character vector, and the list-of-length-1-characters a JSON array parses as.
#' A missing value is dropped rather than carried, because it states no label and
#' no datom write can produce one -- carried through, it would become a branch
#' named `NA`.
#'
#' @param v A tag value.
#' @return A character vector, possibly empty.
#' @keywords internal

  if (is.null(v) || length(v) == 0L) return(character())

  chr <- if (is.character(v)) v else as.character(unlist(v, use.names = FALSE))
  chr[!is.na(chr)]
}


# --- the one expander ----------------------------------------------------------

#' One Member's Tags as Key/Value Pairs
#'
#' A member with no tags yields one pair of `NA` / `NA`, which is what keeps an
#' untagged member visible in a listing rather than absent from it.
#'
#' A key whose value is empty also yields `NA` rather than no row. The writer
#' drops such a key, so this reaches only a hand-built payload -- and there the
#' key IS in the document, so reporting the key with no value states what is
#' there while dropping the row would not.
#'
#' **THE MAP IS READ BY POSITION, NEVER BY NAME, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF
#' THE FUNCTION.** A tag map can carry the same key twice -- `jsonlite` parses
#' `{"type": "output", "type": "baseline"}` into two same-named elements, and a
#' caller can write `list(type = "a", type = "b")` -- and nothing on the read side
#' refuses it, because a reader does not validate a tag map. `tags[["type"]]`
#' returns the **first** match every time, so a by-name read reports one label
#' twice and loses the other: the member lists a value it does not have, vanishes
#' from a branch it belongs under, and cannot be found by the label the document
#' says it carries. Verified in all three verbs before this was positional.
#'
#' That is the file header's one-expander rule reappearing on the **key** axis.
#' Having one expander closed the silent-first-value spelling on the *value* axis;
#' reading that expander's own input by name reopened the identical failure one
#' level up.
#'
#' Duplicate keys are therefore treated exactly as one multi-valued key would be,
#' which is also what they mean. Identical pairs are **not** collapsed across
#' duplicate keys: the read reports what the document holds, and deduplicating
#' here would be a reader canonicalizing.

# --- the three verbs -----------------------------------------------------------

#' Get the Data Behind One Member of a Set
#'
#' Returns what one [member][datom-package] of a set points at, at the exact
#' version the set records: a data frame for a table, another set for a set.
#' Name the member, as in `datom_fetch_member(conn, x, "dm")`, and pass a
#' connection to that member's own project.
#'
#' `x$members[[i]]$fetch(conn)` does the same thing.
#'
#' This is kind dispatch at the **member** level, which is the only level it
#' belongs at. Iterating members, a caller cannot know each one's kind in advance;
#' at the top level they named one artifact they chose, which is why
#' [datom_read()] and [datom_get_set()] stay separate verbs.
#'
#' @section Naming a member:
#' `member` accepts the three shapes a caller actually holds, so a console call
#' and a loop use one verb:
#'
#' | What you pass | Where it comes from |
#' |---|---|
#' | a name | you read the set and know what you want |
#' | a member record | `datom_member()`, or `x$members[[i]]` |
#' | a link | `x$members[[i]]$fetch`, or a leaf of `datom_structure_members()` |
#'
#' **A name is not a key.** The same artifact at two versions is a legal pair of
#' members -- a current table beside a locked baseline, say -- so an ambiguous
#' name aborts and lists the candidates rather than answering with the first.
#' Narrow with `tags`, which is the navigation axis, or pin one exactly with
#' `version`. Both narrow a name only; supplied beside a record or a link they are
#' refused rather than quietly ignored.
#'
#' @section Which connection to pass:
#' The one for the **member's** project. Access in datom is per project and not
#' conjunctive: reading a set needs the set's project only, and resolving a member
#' is a separate, deliberate step. Same-project members resolve through the
#' connection you already have.
#'
#' A member's project is **not** checked against the connection's before the

#' List a Set's Members and Their Labels
#'
#' A data frame with one row per member **per label value** -- long format, not
#' wide. Tags are open-keyed and multi-valued, so a wide frame would need a
#' list-column and a column set that changes from one set to the next; long is a
#' plain frame with fixed columns whatever the set holds.
#'
#' Filtering is therefore ordinary R -- `subset()`, `dplyr::filter()` -- and datom
#' grows no query vocabulary of its own.
#'
#' @section The columns:
#' `name`, `project`, `version` and `kind` identify the member; `key` and `value`
#' are one label. **An untagged member still gets a row**, with `NA` for both, so
#' `unique(m$name)` is the complete member list rather than the tagged part of it.
#'
#' `value` is a plain character column, never a list-column, because the tag
#' grammar is text only.

#' @param x A `datom_set` from [datom_get_set()].

#' Group a Set's Members into a Navigable View
#'
#' Groups members by the values of the label key(s) named in `by` and returns a
#' nested list whose leaves are the members' **links**, so
#' `dp$output$adsl(conn)` works and tab-completes.
#'
#' A pure function of `x` and the axis you ask for: nothing is stored, and datom
#' takes no position on which hierarchy is the right one. Ask for
#' `by = c("domain", "type")` and you get a different tree from the same set,
#' which is that design working rather than being worked around.
#'
#' @section One member, several branches:
#' A member tagged `domain = c("safety", "efficacy")` appears under **both**
#' `safety` and `efficacy`, so the total number of leaves can exceed the number of
#' members. That is the point of labels over folders rather than a quirk of this
#' verb: a folder holds an item in exactly one place, and a label does not.
#'
#' @section What is refused, and why nothing is dropped:
#' Two requests abort, because the alternative in both cases is a member the
#' consumer cannot find and cannot see is absent:
#'
#' * **Two members asking for one leaf name.** Two members may legitimately share
#'   a name at different versions, and if both carry the same label they ask for
#'   the same leaf. The abort names both and points at adding an axis --
#'   `by = c("type", "release")`. The set itself is entirely legal; only this
#'   projection of it is refused.
#' * **A `missing` bucket name that is also a real label value.** The bucket is a
#'   leaf name, so a set where some member genuinely carries
#'   `type = "untagged"` would merge the real branch into the bucket. Refused
#'   whatever the members happen to look like, so that whether the projection
#'   works does not depend on whether a member is currently missing the key.
#'
#' A member that simply lacks the axis key is **not** refused and **not** dropped:
#' it goes under `missing`, named, because a named bucket is visible and an
#' omission is not.
#'
#' @param x A `datom_set` from [datom_get_set()].
#' @param by Character vector of one or more label keys to group by, outermost
#'   first.
#' @param missing Branch name for members carrying no value for an axis key.
#'
#' @return A nested list `length(by) + 1` levels deep: one level per axis, then
#'   the member's own name holding its `datom_link`. An empty list for a set with
#'   no members.

#'   [datom_fetch_member()] to resolve one member by name.
