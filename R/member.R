# Set membership: the member constructor and the validator a set write runs.
#
# A member is a pure-data POINTER at one exact version of one artifact, plus
# optional per-member tags:
#
#   { id: { project, name, kind, version }, tags: { ... } }
#
# The `id`/`tags` split is structural rather than cosmetic. `id` is a reference
# record with four fixed single-string keys; `tags` is an open map of text
# labels. Tags are what replace folder structure -- a folder puts an item in
# exactly one place, whereas a multi-valued tag puts it in several at once, so
# `domain = c("safety", "efficacy")` is the point and not an extension.
#
# THREE THINGS HERE ARE EASY TO GET WRONG BY ANALOGY WITH datom_parent().
#
#   1. A member carries NO `data_sha`. The version already pins content, so a
#      second copy of that fact is a second thing to keep consistent. (The
#      encoder in R/hashable-set.R aborts on any field outside `id`/`tags`, so
#      adding one is loud rather than silent.)
#   2. Tags are TIDIED, THEN VALIDATED -- in that order. Tidying first clears
#      the spellings nobody can reasonably care about, so validation only ever
#      reports genuine ambiguity; validating first would make the tidy rules
#      unreachable.
#   3. A member with no tags OMITS the key. It must never carry `tags = NULL`.
#      The hash is identical either way, so nothing here would fail -- but
#      `jsonlite` writes a NULL element as `{}` rather than dropping it, so
#      every untagged member would land in the stored payload carrying an empty
#      object, which is the one spelling a writer must never emit.
#
# There is deliberately NO cycle detection, no visited-set guard, and no depth
# limit. A member pins an immutable version and declaring one requires that
# version to already exist, so a set cannot reference anything that contains it
# -- the same property that makes git history acyclic. datom also resolves one
# level and never traverses. Both reasons are independently sufficient; do not
# reintroduce any of the three as defensive code.


#' Is a Value a Single Non-Empty, Non-Missing String?
#'
#' The field test used by the member validator. Deliberately **stricter than
#' `.datom_validate_parents()`'s equivalent**, which accepts `NA_character_`:
#' that value is character, has length 1, and `nzchar(NA_character_)` is `TRUE`,
#' so the obvious three-part test lets it through. A missing value in a member's
#' `id` would be spliced into a storage key or written into a citable payload,
#' so it is refused here.
#'
#' @param x Value to test.
#' @return `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
#' @keywords internal
.datom_is_text_scalar <- function(x) {
  is.character(x) && length(x) == 1L && !is.na(x) && nzchar(x)
}


#' Drop Tag Keys Whose Value Is Empty
#'
#' The one tidy rule this file owns: a key that points at nothing is removed,
#' because a tag with no values is spelled by omitting the key. Note this is
#' about a tag *value*, not about a member having no tags at all -- a member with
#' no tags is the ordinary case and is simply accepted. Nothing is lost here --
#' an empty value states no fact -- and leaving it in would be worse than
#' cosmetic:
#' a present key with an empty value hashes differently from an absent key, so
#' the same fact would mint two different `data_sha` values.
#'
#' Covers both empty spellings R produces. `character(0)` is the documented one;
#' `NULL` is what an absent value looks like when a tag map is composed
#' programmatically (`list(domain = f())` where `f()` returned nothing), and it
#' means exactly the same thing. Note the encoder still refuses a `NULL` value,
#' and must: there it arrives from a parsed file rather than from a caller, so
#' there is no caller intent to tidy toward.
#'
#' Full canonicalization -- sorting keys, sorting and deduplicating values,
#' unboxing single values, ordering members -- is **not** done here. It belongs
#' to the set write, so that canonical form has exactly one implementation.
#'
#' @param tags A named list, or `NULL`.
#' @return `tags` with empty-valued keys removed; `NULL` unchanged. A
#'   non-list is returned untouched, so the validator reports the type rather
#'   than this function failing on it.

#' Validate a Tag Map
#'
#' The tag grammar, in one place, shared by [datom_member()] (its `tags`
#' argument), the member validator (each member's `tags`), and the set write
#' (set-level `tags`). A tag map is a named list whose values are UTF-8 strings
#' or arrays of them -- no numbers, booleans, `null`, or nesting.
#'
#' Per-value type checking delegates to `.datom_sv1_as_strings()`, the same
#' coercion the hash encoder uses, rather than restating its rules. That is
#' deliberate: two copies of "what counts as text here" would eventually
#' disagree, and the encoder's messages already name the offending key and the
#' allowed types. What this function adds on top is the **empty-label** refusal,
#' which the encoder does not make -- there, `""` hashes as an ordinary label.
#'
#' An empty value is **not** refused, because it is a tidy case rather than an

#' Which of the Three Shapes a Member Argument Arrived In
#'
#' A caller naming one member holds one of three things, and every verb that
#' takes a member accepts all three: a **name**, a **member record** (what
#' [datom_member()] returns, and what stripping a read set's links produces), or
#' a **link** (a member's `fetch` element, or a leaf of
#' [datom_structure_members()]).
#'
#' This is the shape dispatch alone, deliberately without the lookup. What a
#' **name** means differs by verb -- to [datom_fetch_member()] it is a member of
#' the set already in hand, to [datom_add_member()] it is an artifact to look up
#' in the project's storage -- so handing the name back to the caller is what lets
#' one dispatch serve both without either searching the wrong thing.
#'
#' The refusal of `tags` / `version` beside a record or a link is left to each
#' caller too: both refuse, and the reason differs enough to word differently
#' (narrowing a search versus declaring a member twice). `shape` is the phrase to

#' Which Project an Artifact Belongs To, From the Repo Rather Than a Label
#'
#' The cascade both pointer constructors use -- [datom_member()] and
#' [datom_parent()] -- to answer "which project is this artifact in" without
#' trusting the connection it was reached through.
#'
#' **Why a label cannot be trusted.** On a connection built from a clone, datom
#' reads `project_name` out of `.datom/project.yaml`, so it is the repo's own
#' declaration. On a **reader** connection it is a string the caller passed to
#' [datom_get_conn()]: the namespace comes from the store's root and prefix, and
#' nothing compares the label against the repo. Both constructors write the name
#' they settle on into a stored document -- a member's `id$project` is hashed into
#' the set's `data_sha` and cited afterwards, and a parent's `source` is part of
#' the declaring table's version -- so a label nobody checked would be durable
#' wrong data that no hash and no validator can notice.
#'
#' Three steps, cheapest and most trustworthy first:
#'
#' 1. **The artifact's own snapshot**, which the caller has already read. Free,
#'    and it is the writing repo's declaration.
#' 2. **The manifest of the namespace the artifact lives in**. One extra read, and
#'    only for an artifact written before datom recorded the field -- which is
#'    every artifact in every existing repo, so this is the common path in this
#'    release rather than a rare one. Goes through the gated reader, so a
#'    manifest whose format this build cannot read is handled the one way datom
#'    handles that anywhere; when the manifest is unusable, that reader can
#'    escalate to reconstructing the index from a namespace listing, which is
#'    accepted because a repo in that state needs attention regardless.
#' 3. **The connection's label**, said out loud to be unverified.
#'
#' **One gap, named rather than guarded.** When the manifest has to be
#' reconstructed and the document it replaced recorded no project name, the
#' reconstruction fills that field from the connection
#' ([.datom_rebuild_manifest()]), so step 2 can hand back the label while looking
#' like the repo's declaration. What is lost there is the *warning*, not the
#' value: the string is exactly the one step 3 would have returned. Closing it
#' properly means the shared manifest reader reporting whether the document it
#' returned was reconstructed, which is a change to that reader rather than to
#' this cascade.
#'
#' @param conn The connection the artifact was read through.
#' @param snap The artifact's metadata snapshot, already read and already checked
#'   for a format this build understands.

#' Declare a Member of a Set
#'
#' Resolves one artifact version against a single project connection and returns
#' a pure-data member record to pass to a set write. The record is a pointer:
#' it names the project, artifact, kind, and version, and carries no copy of the
#' data. Reading the artifact's versioned metadata snapshot is what makes the
#' pointer trustworthy -- a member can only point at something that already
#' exists, which is also why a set cannot contain itself at any depth.
#'
#' Same-project and cross-project members are declared identically; the only
#' difference is which connection is passed. `kind` comes from the snapshot
#' (defaulting to `"table"` for a snapshot written before datom recorded the
#' field), and `project` comes from the **repo** rather than from the connection:
#' the artifact's own metadata, else the project manifest, else the connection's
#' name with a warning saying it is unverified. That matters because a reader
#' connection's project name is a label the caller supplied and nothing checks it
#' against the repo, while this value is hashed into the set's identity and cited
#' afterwards.
#'
#' Unlike [datom_parent()], a member carries **no `data_sha`**: the version
#' already pins the content, and a second copy of that fact would be a second
#' thing to keep consistent.
#'
#' @section Tags:
#' `tags` is an optional named list of text labels describing this member's role
#' in the set -- what folder structure would otherwise express. A value may be a
#' single string or several, because the whole point of labels over folders is
#' that an item can be in more than one category at once:
#' `list(type = "output", domain = c("safety", "efficacy"))`.
#'
#' Values are text only: no numbers, booleans, or nesting. Write a numeric label
#' as a string (`"500"`) and parse it downstream, exactly as you would a folder
#' name.
#'
#' Three outcomes, and the difference is whether anything is actually there:
#'
#' | What you pass | What happens |
#' |---|---|
#' | no `tags` | accepted; the record carries no `tags` |
#' | `list(domain = character(0))` or `list(domain = NULL)` | the key is dropped, as if never mentioned |
#' | `list(domain = "")` | refused -- a label with no name is almost always an accident |

  # for one written by a build this version cannot fully parse -- there, a set
  # would be recorded as a table, and that misreading is durable: it goes into
  # the member record, into the stored payload, and into the set's own identity,
  # with nothing failing. Refusing a too-new document first is what separates
  # "old, therefore certainly a table" from "newer, therefore unknown".
  #
  # Deliberately OUTSIDE the handler above: inside it, a refusal would be
  # reworded as "member not found", which buries the one actionable line.
  # Same pairing as `.datom_rebuild_manifest_entry()`, which checks and then
  # falls back in the same way.
