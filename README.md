## A right-sized foundation for versioned, traceable data

Analytical work depends on data that continues to change. A single
project may involve dozens or hundreds of tables, with further tables
derived from them and transformation logic that evolves alongside the
analysis. Keeping this body of data trackable and reproducible – across
revisions and across collaborators – is a substantial, ongoing task, and
one that ad-hoc collections of dated files handle poorly.

A common response is to adopt a data platform: a warehouse, a lakehouse,
or a relational database. For datasets of this size, that is usually
more machinery than the problem warrants. Distributed compute,
transactional guarantees, and a running server carry real cost and
operational overhead, and even then the versioning and lineage that
motivated the move often still require custom work.

**datom** provides that capability directly. It offers versioned,
content-addressed storage with deduplication, complete data lineage, and
reproducible access to any prior state, alongside a clear separation
between those who write data and those who read it. It is built on tools
already available to most data scientists – git and optionally cloud
object storage – and requires no server, database, or platform to
operate. In practice, you hand datom a set of tables and receive a
durable, versioned reference to them; datom manages what sits beneath.

It is deliberately modest to adopt, and it does not constrain what
follows: the same setup serves a single analyst today and, with the
governance layer, a managed portfolio of projects later.

> *datom – the atomic, immutable unit of your data.*

## Where datom fits, and where it does not

datom rests on a few assumptions about the work it supports. Where they
hold, it removes a considerable amount of unnecessary cost and
complexity. Where they do not, another tool is the better choice.

**Individual tables are modest in size** – typically under a terabyte
each, though there is no hard limit and no constraint on how many tables
you manage. In aggregate the data can be large; datom simply assumes
each table fits comfortably in a single read. If you require
transactional (ACID) guarantees or high-throughput concurrent writes
over very large individual tables, a database or warehouse is the
appropriate tool.

**Your computation fits in memory.** Most of the analysis runs
comfortably on a modern workstation. If your work depends on
distributed, server-side aggregation over big data, datom is not
intended to replace that.

**You are not already getting this from an existing investment.** If a
combination of platform and custom tooling already delivers versioning,
lineage, and governed access at a cost you find acceptable, datom has
little to add. Its value is greatest when that capability is missing –
and when you would rather not take on the recurring cost of compute,
servers, and platform maintenance to get it.

In short, datom aims to be what this kind of work needs, and not what it
does not.

## Clinical statistical programming and data management

datom’s primary use case today is clinical data science – the regulated,
audit-sensitive environment where statistical programmers and data
managers produce datasets that underpin regulatory submissions.

In a typical clinical trial, raw EDC extracts arrive in periodic cuts.
Each cut generates a new set of SDTM or ADaM tables. Derived datasets
depend on earlier ones, and the transformation logic evolves as the
study matures. At lock, a submission package must demonstrate exactly
which data was present at each milestone, which derivations produced it,
and that no silent edits occurred between cuts.

datom provides this out of the box:

- **Immutable, SHA-addressed versions** – every data cut is a
  content-stamped snapshot. Reviewers and auditors can retrieve exactly
  what existed at any prior point.
- **Complete lineage** – every derived table records which parent tables
  (and which versions of those parents) it descends from, traceable back
  to the raw source.
- **Reader/developer separation** – statisticians who consume data
  operate in a read-only mode that requires no git access, no server,
  and no platform credentials beyond storage. Data managers who produce
  data operate through a git-backed write path with full audit trail.
- **No infrastructure to maintain** – no database server, no scheduler,
  no platform team. The data sits in object storage (or a shared
  filesystem); the audit trail sits in git.

This supports the path from raw EDC extracts through to locked,
auditable analysis datasets – with reproducibility, traceability, and
governance built into the data layer rather than bolted on after the
fact.

## Installation

Install the released version from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("datom")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("amashadihossein/datom")
```

## A two-minute tour

> **What this tour builds:** a shared, versioned data space with
> reproducible reads for multiple engineers and analysts – coordinated
> through a single git history. Every `datom_write()` is a commit; every
> `datom_read()` resolves to an exact content SHA. No one can silently
> overwrite history.

**Before you start:** you need a GitHub personal access token (PAT)
scoped to `repo`. While you don’t need to have this token stored in your
OS keychain, use of `keyring` is recommended for security and ease of
use.

``` r
keyring::key_set("GITHUB_PAT")          # one-time setup
nzchar(keyring::key_get("GITHUB_PAT"))  # verify -- should return TRUE
```

Using `keyring` keeps the PAT out of your code and command history; see
the `keyring` package documentation for setup details.

``` r
library(datom)
library(fs)

# Two paths, two roles:
#   dev_dir  -- your local workspace for this project (stays on your machine)
#   data_dir -- where the actual data lives; point this at a shared location
#               (network drive, S3, etc.) for team access. Temp dir used here
#               for demonstration -- replace with a real path when you're ready.
dev_dir  <- path(tempdir(), "study_001_dev")
data_dir <- path(tempdir(), "study_001_data")
dir_create(data_dir)

# Build a store (the only credential needed is your GitHub PAT).
data_component <- datom_store_local(path = data_dir)

store <- datom_store(
  governance = NULL,
  data       = data_component,
  github_pat = keyring::key_get("GITHUB_PAT")
)

# Initialize a project: registers it on GitHub and sets up your dev workspace.
datom_init_repo(
  path         = dev_dir,
  project_name = "STUDY_001",
  store        = store,
  create_repo  = TRUE,
  repo_name    = "study-001-data"
)

conn <- datom_get_conn(path = dev_dir, store = store)

# Explore what was created before writing anything.
fs::dir_tree(dev_dir)   # your local workspace
fs::dir_tree(data_dir)  # data storage (empty until first write)
```

Now write a table – twice – and watch datom do the right thing:

``` r
dm <- datom_example_data("dm", cutoff_date = "2026-01-28")

datom_write(conn, data = dm, name = "dm", message = "Initial DM extract")
#> v Wrote "dm" (full): "a8ee7a31"

# Same data again. datom recognizes it and skips.
datom_write(conn, data = dm, name = "dm")
#> i No changes detected for "dm". Skipping write.

datom_list(conn)
#>   name current_version current_data_sha last_updated
#> 1   dm         a8ee7a31         4b6d0a7e 2026-01-28T...

# datom reads back data as a tibble. Use tibble::as_tibble() on the
# original for a clean round-trip comparison.
identical(datom_read(conn, "dm"), tibble::as_tibble(dm))
#> [1] TRUE
```

Three things just happened that are worth pausing on:

1.  **Reproducibility is now built in** – every write minted a SHA tied
    to the data itself. That SHA is how you read back, list, diff, and
    audit. Same data on any machine returns the same SHA; same SHA
    always returns the same bytes. `datom_read()`, `datom_list()`, and
    `datom_history()` are all just different views into the same
    versioned record.
2.  **Idempotent writes** – re-writing the same data was a free no-op.
    Pipelines are safe to re-run without polluting history.
3.  **Data as code** – the version history is in git: diffable,
    reviewable, and shareable like any other code asset. The data bytes
    stayed in `data_dir` – nothing sensitive went to GitHub. Before you
    tear down, open `https://github.com/<your-username>/study-001-data`
    and look at the commits: you will see the full audit trail with no
    data bytes in sight.

## Teardown

Pick one:

``` r
# Option A -- full scripted teardown (deletes local files AND the GitHub repo).
# Do this BEFORE unlink().
datom_repo_delete(conn, confirm = "STUDY_001")

# Option B -- local only (GitHub repo stays; delete it manually from the UI).
unlink(c(dev_dir, data_dir), recursive = TRUE)
```

Do not call `unlink()` before `datom_repo_delete()` – removing the local
clone first strips the GitHub remote reference and the remote repo will
not be deleted.

## Where to go next

The [Get Started](https://amashadihossein.github.io/datom/articles/)
article walks through a complete sync-based workflow – from a single
file to a batch of extracts – on a local filesystem, then the S3 article
mirrors it in object storage.

| When you are ready for | Article |
|----|----|
| The same workflow directly in S3 object storage | [Starting on S3](https://amashadihossein.github.io/datom/articles/start-on-s3.html) |
| Tracing how derived tables descend from raw | [Tracing Data Lineage](https://amashadihossein.github.io/datom/articles/source-lineage.html) |

For the design rationale – why two repos, what `ref.json` does, how SHAs
are computed – see the **Design** articles in the same site, or
`dev/datom_specification.md` for the full technical specification.
