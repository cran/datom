# Editing a set that already exists: repointing members at newer versions.
#
# TWO KINDS OF FIXTURE, for the reason the other set files use two. Repointing
# reads real documents -- a project manifest to learn what is current, then the
# new version's own snapshot -- so most of this runs against a real repo, a real
# bare remote and a real local store. A few cases can only be built by hand: a
# member recorded in a project nobody supplied a connection for, a label whose
# value is empty, an artifact that is not in the manifest at all.
#
# FOUR OF THESE ARE THE TESTS A PLAUSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION PASSES EVERYTHING ELSE
# WHILE FAILING.
#
#   * The labels test asserts BYTE-IDENTITY and carries a key whose value is
#     empty. The obvious spelling -- rebuild the pointer with the old labels --
#     drops that key silently, and every payload datom wrote is tidied already,
#     so an ordinary fixture cannot see it. The test asserts the naive route
#     really does lose it, so the assertion cannot rot into a tautology.
#   * The link test resolves the repointed member to DATA and counts rows. A
#     member whose `id` moved while its `fetch` did not contradicts itself
#     silently, and every assertion on `id` still passes.
#   * The mislabelled-connection test needs TWO stores. One store cannot tell a
#     wrong label from a right one, because the member and the store then agree.
#   * The no-op test asserts through the WRITE, because "this refresh was free"
#     is observable there and nowhere else.
