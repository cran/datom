# A datom repo routinely holds content datom does not own -- a build package's
# code, its environment lockfile, its own working files -- because the product
# repo is the joint repo. Two guarantees follow, and both were true by accident
# of implementation before they were true on purpose (R14.1, R14.2). These tests
# are what make a later refactor that breaks either one fail here rather than in
# somebody's repo.
#
# Why each test is shaped the way it is, since three cheaper spellings all pass
# while defending nothing:
#
#   * The commit-isolation test reads the REAL commit tree. There is already a
#     test that mocks `.datom_git_commit()` and inspects the file list it was
#     handed (`test-read-write.R`, "datom_write commits manifest.json"); adding
#     an exclusion assertion there would stay green through exactly the add-all
#     refactor this guards against, because the mock replaces the function whose
#     file list IS the guarantee. So: real git, real write, and the commit's tree
#     read back with git2r.
#   * The working-tree half is asserted separately. A write that "helpfully"
#     cleaned the tree would leave the commit correct and the developer's edit
#     gone, so excluded-from-the-commit and still-dirty are two claims.
#   * The foreign directory is named `dp/`, which is NOT one of the seven names
#     `.datom_validate_tables()` drops by hardcoded name. A test using `R/` or
#     `renv/` passes through that list and would stay green if the
#     `metadata.json` filter -- the mechanism R14.2 actually rests on -- were
#     deleted.
#
# Tolerance has two mechanisms on two surfaces and neither implies the other:
# artifact discovery filters directories on the presence of `metadata.json`,
# while the repo-level checks walk an explicit list of files datom expects and so
# never enumerate the repo at all. A refactor of the second into a directory walk
# would satisfy the first test and break R14.2.
