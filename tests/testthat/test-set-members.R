# Finding and shaping a set's members: the three verbs over a `datom_set`.
#
# Two kinds of fixture, deliberately. The two shaping verbs do no IO at all, so
# they are tested against a set built by hand -- which is also the only way to
# construct the cases a writer refuses (two members of one name, a member
# carrying the bucket's own name as a label). `datom_fetch_member()` runs against
# a real repo, a real bare remote and a real local store, because what it claims
# is about the composition rather than about any one function.
#
# THREE OF THESE ARE THE TESTS A PLAUSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION PASSES EVERYTHING ELSE
# WHILE FAILING.
#
#   * The two-branch test asserts the LEAF COUNT EXCEEDS THE MEMBER COUNT. Taking
#     the first value of a multi-valued tag is silent and passes any test that
#     only checks a member is somewhere.
#   * The zero-row frame is proved by `rbind()`ing it onto a populated one. A
#     frame built from zero rows loses its columns, and nothing notices until
#     somebody binds two results -- which is exactly how this defect reached
#     `datom_list()` twice.
#   * The project hint is proved BOTH WAYS: it appears when the names differ, and
#     the original condition is re-signalled with its own class when they agree.
#     A rewrap that always fires would reword failures that have nothing to do
#     with projects, and every other test here still passes.
