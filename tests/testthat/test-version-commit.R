# The version-to-commit link: `commit_sha` on the stored version history.
#
# THREE FUNCTIONS UPLOAD `version_history.json`, and each one is a chance to
# erase the field, because the clone's copy can never carry it -- that file is
# inside the commit it would name. So there is one test per upload route, and
# each was confirmed to redden when ONLY that route's merge is removed:
#
#   the ordinary write     `.datom_push_metadata_s3()`   -> "the ordinary write ..."
#   the repair             `.datom_sync_one_artifact()`  -> "datom_validate(fix = TRUE) ..."
#   the metadata-only sync `.datom_sync_metadata()`      -> "the metadata-only route ..."
#
# A single "after a repair the field is still there" test satisfies none of the
# three: the ordinary write is the route that loses the field FIRST, on the second
# write of an artifact, with no repair involved.
#
# Nothing here mocks the datom stack. Real git repo, real bare remote, real local
# store, because every claim is about the composition of commit, push and upload.
