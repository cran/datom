# Forward compatibility: a field this build cannot place survives a write.
#
# The failure being prevented: datom rebuilds its own documents from scratch on a
# write rather than editing them, so a top-level field written by a newer datom
# is not merely ignored -- it is deleted. The requirement covers three levels,
# and they need different amounts of code, which is why they get separate tests:
# a table's own metadata document and one row of the manifest are both rebuilt
# and so must carry unfamiliar fields explicitly, while the manifest's top level
# is read-modify-written and survives without any help. The third case is tested
# precisely because it holds by accident of structure -- a later refactor that
# rebuilt the document instead would break it silently.
#
# The unit tests below drive the helpers directly; the round trips go through the
# real write path on a real git repo and a real local store, because the claim is
# about the composition (build -> merge -> write file -> push -> mirror), not
# about any one function.

# The merge is still worth pinning, for two reasons. The version-history entry
# below is genuinely live -- the refusal's scope does not include that document.
# And the day a release widens what the door accepts, the merge behind it has to
# already work; a merge that quietly broke while unreachable would ship as a
# silent field deletion on the first write that got through.
