# The set write path: two gates, tidy-then-validate, canonical form, the dual
# write, and the manifest row.
#
# Most of these run against a real git repo, a real bare remote and a real local
# store with nothing mocked, because almost every claim here is about the
# COMPOSITION -- canonicalize, hash, write the git copy, commit, push, mirror --
# rather than about any one function. The two that mock do so to observe an
# absence.
#
# Three things below are the tests that a naive implementation passes everything
# else while failing:
#
#   * the canonical form is asserted on the FILE BYTES, not on the return value.
#     Several payload spellings share one `data_sha`, so a hash comparison cannot
#     see whether the stored bytes were normalised.
#   * the metadata document's field set is asserted on the file too, because
#     `jsonlite` writes a NULL element as `{}` -- a `document_sha` left
#     unpopulated would satisfy a names-only check while carrying an empty object.
#   * a payload whose `data_sha` is already in history must not be re-uploaded,
#     proved with a backdated mtime. Byte comparison cannot tell "not
#     re-uploaded" from "re-uploaded identical bytes".

# === the joint commit (include_paths) =========================================
#
# `include_paths` is the only way a commit datom makes on its own initiative may
# carry a path datom does not own. What it buys is that checking out a set
# version's commit yields the data pointers AND the code and environment that
# produced them -- so every test here is about a commit either containing exactly
# what it claims, or not existing at all.
#
# Three shapes below exist because the cheaper spelling passes while defending
# nothing:
#
#   * the no-op test reads GIT, not the return value. The hazard is a write that
#     commits the dirty code and still reports `action == "none"`, and an
#     assertion on the returned list stays green through exactly that. So: HEAD
#     before, HEAD after.
#   * the same test asserts the foreign file is dirty BEFORE and AFTER. Without
#     the before half it can pass in a repo where nothing changed; without the
#     after half a write that "helpfully" committed and cleaned the file would
#     still fail only on the HEAD assertion.
#   * the two AC20 gates get one test each, so a regression names which gate
#     broke rather than reporting "include_paths validation".
